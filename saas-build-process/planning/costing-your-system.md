# Costing your system

## Costing a SaaS is not simple. 

There are a lot of moving parts, and the devil is in the details. So the trick to effectively getting cost estimates on your system is to take a hard, deep look at all the details. After you have reviewed all the details, assigned hours, and re-reviewed costs, then you will have a good idea if your system is going to be ‘worth it’. From there, you can move into a more complete method of costing.

### Example Spreadsheet:

[The example spreadsheet can be seen here with potential costs for your system.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qC2h5e_YFvCAAoWA4Vaj1U7k7XPjsUMuqVoLKLAZh0I/edit?usp=sharing)

## Breaking down your costs:

As we start to analyse costs, there are a few assumptions that are being made here that you may or may not want to use. Assumptions include:

1. We are taking into account the cost of your time.
2. The cost of your system does not include just the build cost as you will have to run the business moving forward, and even if you fire everyone and just let the system ride, you will still have some ongoing costs. For this reason, we are going to determine costs broken into the following for the first year of business:
   1. Upfront or build costs
   2. Ongoing costs
3. Costing a system like this includes ongoing costs that include things like personnel, hosting, and software.

Here is a list of the general areas you’re going to need to review:

* Costs to build:
  * Initial/MVP Release:
    * Research/Validation time
    * MVP build cost
  * Minimum Viable Sellable Product \(MVSP\) Release
    * Release version/post MVP cost
* Costs to market:
  * Man hours
  * Software
  * Ad spend
* Support
  * Software
  * Man hours
* Operations
  * Hosting
  * System support
  * Additional system build

## Formula for cost to build based on features & complexity

As you know, SaaS tools and platforms range in size, complexity, reach, and much, much more. So the range of time vary tremendously.

### MVP Release:

The items below have been done for you in the attached spreadsheet. Within [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qC2h5e_YFvCAAoWA4Vaj1U7k7XPjsUMuqVoLKLAZh0I/edit#gid=92137450) you have:

1. A list of ‘standard’ features that are considered to be a part of most SaaS systems.
2. A list of ‘core’ features of your system which are outside the functionality of standard SaaS features.
3. Standard costs for a marketing website
4. Operational costs including software, personnel, and miscellaneous business items.   

All of these items come together on the main page of the spreadsheet to allow you to see the total costs and play around with costs.

### Standard SaaS features include things such as:

* Promotional website
* User login/logout
* User management - where user can manage their information
* Admin panel
* Dashboard or initially logged in area

### Marketing Website - This area includes items such as:

* Home page
* Tour
* Features
* Pricing
* Blog
* Company
* Legal pages
* Signup or get started page

### Operational costs including:

* Project management software
* Company emails
* Password management systems
* Chatbot software
* Marketing systems
* Advertising spend
* Business setup and miscellaneous items
* Personnel 

### Systems & Team Differences

Each system and team is different. This pricing system is simply a guide to help you get started. It is important to go through this system carefully and price each area as thoroughly as possible before starting the build of your system.

**PROTIP:** The system was costed as if you were paying a full-time team to build and operate this system. This is just ONE WAY of building this system, and many companies start off with just hiring contractors to build certain aspects of the system and operate the majority of the system themselves. Please keep this in mind as your progress through this area.
