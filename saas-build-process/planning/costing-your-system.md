# Costing Your System

## Breaking Down the Costing Process

Costing is far from simple. In fact, it is likely the most tedious part of the planning phase of development. It is also the most vital, though. Properly costing your build process will prove essential in mapping out the project and then keeping it on time and on budget.

There are four phases to costing your project:

1. Estimate
2. Scope & Flows
3. Operation Costs
4. Working Numbers

We'll review each step briefly here, but there will also be a more thorough breakdown below.

### Estimate

Calculating an estimation for your project does not mean throwing some numbers on a board or using basic rounding techniques to find a rough number like you might have done in middle school. Your estimation is, essentially, going to serve as a rough draft of your scope of work. That means you're looking at hard, in-depth estimates for multiple categories and minimums and maximums for each.

Your estimation is still just that: an estimate. It's not final, and it's certainly not exact, but it should give a firm idea of what the project _will_ cost. This is important, because the numbers your client has in mind are very likely nowhere near what the project will _actually_ cost.

### Scope & Flows

Your estimate will then be fleshed out further into a full scope of work. If you're not familiar with project scoping, then feel free to check out [this comprehensive guide to scoping](http://www.brainleaf.com/learn-project-scoping) at Brainleaf, or just read on, as the next page focuses solely on that element of planning.

Your scope of work will serve as your actual roadmap for the project. This overall plan keeps everybody, at all levels of the project, on the same page. In short, it allows every member of your team to know what they need to be working on -- what needs to be done -- and when; the client is also clued into all this. You can also use it to make certain the client can see the impact of any last-minute changes on the scope before they're implemented.

It might seem like a waste of time at first, but the value of a good scope of work cannot be overstated.

### Operation Costs

It is important to remember throughout the planning phase that you are not just building a website or a SaaS tool - you're also building a _business_. You have to begin planning for not only the creation and utilization of the tool, but also for continued operation of the tool, implementation of new features, and support for your customers. You'll have staff that needs to be paid, overhead to track, advertising to purchase, and much more.

And if you don't begin calculating these costs now, they'll catch you off guard later, and you'll potentially have underpriced your services, leaving you scrabbling to make up the difference after launch.

### Working Numbers

Then, when your scope is finished, you can present a "final" quote to the client. At this point, the quote will include all of the coding, design, and every other bit of work that will need to be done. Yet, remember that the total you come up with here still isn't quite "final". So despite that you might call this a final quote, these working numbers might still fluctuate a bit over the course of the project. 

The point is that the client will be able to see how it all comes together, where each penny of the quote comes from and how it's all added up. Then, once they have signed off on the work to be done, once they have acknowledged the time and the cost -- then you can begin work in earnest.

## Reviewing the General Costs of Your Project

Building a SaaS or a website is a lot more complicated than most people realize. There are a lot of moving parts involved, and the devil is in the details. The trick to getting accurate cost estimates on your system is to take a hard, deep look at all of those details. After you have reviewed the details, assigned hours, and re-reviewed costs, then you will have a good idea if your system is going to be ‘worth it’. From there, you can move into a more complete method of costing.

### Be As Thorough as Possible, and Then Some

The sheer number of elements you have to account for is daunting. Chances are, if you're running your first project, you're going to overlook a large number of things that should be getting mapped out in planning. It just happens.

However, that's also why these resources exist - to help you realize what you're missing and to give you insight and knowledge that others have learned the hard way. So, for your benefit, here is a short list of the major elements you need to account for:

* Costs to build:
  * Initial/MVP Release:
    * Research/Validation time
    * MVP build cost
      * Coding/development
      * Planning
      * UX Design
      * Building/running tests
      * Initial integrations
      * Project Management
  * Minimum Viable Sellable Product \(MVSP\) Release
    * Release version/post MVP cost
* Costs to market:
  * Man hours
  * Software
  * Ad spend
* Support
  * Software
  * Man hours
* Operations
  * Hosting
  * System support
  * Ad spend
  * Additional system build
    * Long-term additional integrations

This, of course, is just a short, simplified list. The rest of this book will, of course, expound upon all of this. The article linked here, though, is also a good breakdown focusing on the various elements you have to consider.

## How to Create an Estimate

Creating your initial estimate isn't going to be easy. There are a lot of considerations, as the list above should have highlighted. We're going to go a bit more into that now, though.

### The Estimation Labyrinth

The secret of creating a good estimate is experience. If you're drafting an estimate for the first time, you're going to make mistakes. The process is very similar to navigating a labyrinth - the twists and turns are confusing, there are issues that seemingly arise out of nowhere like roaming minotaurs, and you may end up with a monstrous estimation gap - a Goblin King you were unprepared to deal with.

However, these issues can all be dealt with. You may not have the experience or the knowledge, but others have trekked this path before you, and we can show you where the pitfalls are, how to avoid the frightening problems that might otherwise surprise you, how to deal with a huge gap, and pretty much anything else. 

Don't forget to utilize your resources. Do your research.



### An Example of An Estimate-Creation Process

The below article delves into the process that I have developed with my team for creating accurate estimates. These estimates then expand into our project scope with relative ease. Check out the article for more information. Below that is a link to the spreadsheet we use, which has numbers already put in as an example for your use.

{% embed url="https://jhmediagroup.com/blog/2019/02/28/how-to-estimate-the-cost-of-a-saas/" %}

#### Example Spreadsheet:

[The example spreadsheet can be seen here with potential costs for your system.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qC2h5e_YFvCAAoWA4Vaj1U7k7XPjsUMuqVoLKLAZh0I/edit?usp=sharing)

### Formula for cost to build based on features & complexity

Here, we'll expand upon the initial list from earlier, and we'll refer a bit to the numbers mentioned in the spreadsheet linked just above. 

As you know, SaaS tools and platforms range in size, complexity, reach, and much, much more. So the range of time vary tremendously.

#### MVP Release:

The items below have been done for you in the attached spreadsheet. Within the spreadsheet you have:

1. A list of ‘standard’ features that are considered to be a part of most SaaS systems.
2. A list of ‘core’ features of your system which are outside the functionality of standard SaaS features.
3. Standard costs for a marketing website
4. Operational costs including software, personnel, and miscellaneous business items.   

All of these items come together on the main page of the spreadsheet to allow you to see the total costs and play around with costs.

#### Standard SaaS features include things such as:

* Promotional website
* User login/logout
* User management - where user can manage their information
* Admin panel
* Dashboard or initially logged in area

#### Marketing Website - This area includes items such as:

* Home page
* Tour
* Features
* Pricing
* Blog
* Company
* Legal pages
* Signup or get started page

#### Operational costs including:

* Project management software
* Company emails
* Password management systems
* Chatbot software
* Marketing systems
* Advertising spend
* Business setup and miscellaneous items
* Personnel 

### Presenting the Estimate

Once you have the estimate finalized, it's time to present. You'll need to sit down with your client - whether in person or on a conference call is up to preference - and review each of the line items in detail, giving the client a chance to ask questions about each one, ensuring they fully understand the details of the venture they're about to agree to.

It is entirely possible that they back out after seeing the estimate. If that's the case, then don't try to push them on the issue - you don't want a client who is hesitant to pay what you're owed. That time would be better spent finding a client who will press forward on the project with you.

### Systems & Team Differences

Each system and team is different. This pricing system is simply a guide to help you get started. It is important to go through this system carefully and price each area as thoroughly as possible before starting the build of your system.

{% hint style="success" %}
**PROTIP:** 

The system was costed as if you were paying a full-time team to build and operate this system. This is just ONE WAY of building this system, and many companies start off with just hiring contractors to build certain aspects of the system and operate the majority of the system themselves. Please keep this in mind as your progress through this area.
{% endhint %}

## Presenting Your Final Quote

Once your estimate has been presented and agreed on, then you have to flesh out your scope of work, which will be covered on the next page in depth. Once your scope is ready, it's time to take it to the client for the final approval.

### Be Prepared to Have a Dialogue

This will not necessarily be a one-off discussion. To begin, you're going to need to sit down with the client - again, either in person or on a call - and review each line item. Make certain they understand where each bit of cost comes from. The client may, at this point, opt to make adjustments. They may ask for another meeting after things are cut or added.

Roll with their needs. Advise them. But don't proceed into actual work until you have their signature and acknowledgement of _the work required_ **and** _the cost for that work_.

{% hint style="success" %}
**PROTIP:**

Another element to be certain that you include is an understanding that if they request any changes, any additional features, etc, down the line, then the scope will be updated to reflect that. The client will need to sign off on any such changes before they are implemented.
