# What to expect in SaaS development

These are some lessons that I’ve learned from years of SaaS development that don’t apply to any one thing, but are good to know.

### Deadlines

If you’re working with a good team, expect for people to make their deadlines most of the time, but definitely not all the time.

### Questions

Expect to be asked a lot of questions, a lot more than you expect. You will spend a lot of time answering questions. Often times, you will end up budgeting time every day just to answer questions that you sometimes feel everyone should know. 

### Understanding

That no one will understand the business side like you do. When you’re working with developers, most of the time you are working with people who are paid to do a job, not think about how the business will operate. So don’t expect them to.

### Work time

If you are paying a full time team, they will actually get between 4 and 6 hours of good time in any given day. Or you will have workers that work in sprints for a week or two at a time then need a week off. But don’t expect your team to get a full eight hours per day of concentrated effort. Generally, developers just can’t concentrate for that long every day, day in and day out.

### Unknowns

There will be things you didn’t plan on. Questions you didn’t realize were going to be questions, and problems you never thought would be problems.

### Timelines

Your timeline will be between twenty percent and three times as long as you initially planned, sometimes more.

### Resources

If you are building your own team, you will almost definitely not get all the right people the first time. If you do, please let me know how you did this.

### Money

You will spend more money than you thought you were going to.

### Features

You are going to need more features than you initially planned to build. It is just the way it goes. No matter how experienced the build team or CEO of a system is, there are **ALWAYS** more features that get realized once the system gets underway than were initially planned.

### Use Cases

Expect to learn things about your customers that you never expected. It doesn’t matter how you use the system or how you think people will use the system. They are going to find a way to use it in a way that you never expected.
