# Information Architecture Development

Once you have a validated idea, a pre-sold system, and an estimate that makes business sense it's time to dive into all the aspects of your system. Just like planning any complex machine, you will need to really think through every aspect, every angle, every method for use as you work out your information architecture. 

This chapter takes you, in-depth through what goes into building an information architecture. Even though it is just one of the first steps in building your SaaS business, it is the step that is so often glossed over. Skimming this step will inevitably cost you a substantial amount of money in the long run. On the contrary, the more you have considered exactly what will and will not go into your system at each step, what will go into each feature, and what will make you money in your different phases then you will know what it takes to be successful in your SaaS business. 

I cannot stress the important of being as thorough as possible in this step.
