# Planning & Costing

## This step will save or lose you more money than anything in the project, so don’t rush it. 

Developers want to develop, designers want to design, project managers want to manage, and entrepreneurs want cash flow. But for the most part, very few people are really interested in planning all this stuff out in super fine detail. 

If you’re reading this, you probably fall into one of those categories as well, so listen up, plan like it is your job; plan like your bank account and the success of your project depends on it, because it does. Plan everything -- as much as possible -- and know you are going to change what you are planning and some of that time is going to be wasted, and that is fine.  

This chapter outlines the general steps to be completed, _AFTER_ you have completed your validation and competition analysis.
