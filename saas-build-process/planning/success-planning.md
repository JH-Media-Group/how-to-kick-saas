# Success Planning

## Success comes in one form

This chapter is as much for the developer interested in learning about what they need to know to build a SaaS for a client as it is for the entrepreneur or lead stakeholder in the project. 

Success planning is SaaS development starts with assessing the feasibility of the project from a business standpoint first, then a technology standpoint. If the system is feasibly, then we start looking at what success means for the group building the system. Success can mean a lot of things to different people, but since this is a business, it comes down to these two things:

* Run, provide value, and make money
* Build, grow, sell and make money

Did you think it was going to be something else? You're running a business, and business is about money. There's also the whole personal fulfillment thing. But trust me, its hard to have a lot of personal fulfillment if you're living out of your car, so let's focus on the money.

## Determining Feasibility

This is the same thing as validation. But if you're a developer or development team member that is being hired to do a SaaS project, here is a word of advice; make sure that the project has a high probability of a positive outcome. This means that you think that the thing can make money. If you take a project that crashes and burns to the ground, it's going to at least burn you a bit. It could also take you down with it.  In addition, very often the person or group hiring you to build the system will blame you for it's failure. 

When I am assessing feasibility, I ask a lot of questions about the business. I want to make sure that this project can and will make money for it's investors. Here are some of the questions I ask and things I look into:

### 1. Has the person or group that wants to build the project built a SaaS before? 

As noted elsewhere in this book, the number of times a stakeholder or group has built and launched a SaaS is one of the top indicators of success of a project. 

Here's a quick thought game for you. Why don't you build a computer parts building company instead of this SaaS? 

Most people would say something like "I don't know anything about computer parts. I wouldn't even know where to get started. I don't know the people, I don't know where to sell, I don't know who to sell to, I don't know how to build computer parts!"

The same thing applies here. Building a SaaS is an entire industry. It's not something you're going to learn by just doing it for a month or two. It takes years to understand what you're getting into and run an efficient company, just like building computer parts.

### 2. If the person or group doing the project has not built a SaaS in the past, are they familiar with industry terminology?

If the answer is no, then they have rarely taken the time to research what they are about to get into. The project is probably going to fail. My method for dealing with this group is to tell them that they should read this book. If they read the book, start their validation process, and still want to work on the project, then I am happy to talk to them. If they don't have a background and won't read the book then I won't work with them. If you're reading this book right now since I asked you to read it so we could do a project together, thank you!

### 3. Is the project going to make money?

This is surprisingly simple question most of the time. If a potential client: 

* Knows the target market well
* Is targeting a niche market or has a budget or method to reach a large audience
* Has an in-depth understanding of the problem
* Has a solution that can be explained and understood quickly
* Has easy access to the target market and can in the very least make a few phone calls and get potential buyers on the phone
* Is either knowledgeable about SaaS development processes and project management or is willing to take a fair amount of time to learn
* Is not competing directly with large companies. In particular, behemoth companies like Facebook and Google.
* Has a unique selling proposition that is already well laid out
* [Is entering a blue ocean, not a red ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy)
* If the client wants to compete with large businesses, enter a red ocean, or wants to build a large platform, they MUST have an in-depth understanding of what they are doing and a budget to match. Remember, the bigger the reach and more dug-in the competition the larger the budget is required to gain market share.

### 4. Is the client easy to work with?

Whomever is in charge of the project is managing a company, not just a software system, and a company is made of people. If they are difficult to work with, then there is a lower likelihood that they will be able to manage the growth of the company. More importantly, working with difficult people doesn't make my life any easier, so I don't do it. 

### 5. Can the client take the product to market?

I have met so many people over time that built great tools only to see them fall flat because they could not take those products to market. If the company leader can't market or sell and they don't have a plan for how they will overcome this, then the product probably cannot make it to market.

### The If's

If the client:

1. Understands what they're getting into and is willing to learn
2. Is easy to work with
3. Can manage a team
4. Can sell
5. Has at least a basic understanding of marketing
6. Is willing to validate the idea

If the project:

1. Is focused
2. Has a clearly defined target market that can be reached
3. Is not competing with big companies that already own the market
4. Will make money
5. Will be successful

Then, and only then, it's time to talk about project estimation.
