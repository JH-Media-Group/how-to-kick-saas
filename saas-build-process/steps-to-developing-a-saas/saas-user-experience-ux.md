# SaaS User Experience \(UX\)

## What is UX Design in SaaS?

UX design is, in essence, taking something complicated and making it simple. It is taking a process or set of processes that could be convoluted or frustrating and making them smooth easy to understand, simple and/or fun to use. 

SaaS systems either give you knowledge you didn’t already have \([knowledge gap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.4ttg7f90pxso)\) or save you time \([efficiency gap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.4ttg7f90pxso)\). SaaS systems are built to save you time in one way or another. So making the system intuitive and easy to use innately becomes a critical part of the system. Thus the more time you save, the more valuable the tool becomes. 

Conversely, if you are using and paying for a SaaS specifically to save you time, and is causing you to use extra time, even in small ways, it becomes substantially more frustrating as it is invalidating it’s own use.

Because of this, **SaaS Systems live and die on user experience.** 

**PROTIP:** Something that non-UX designers don’t think about is that UX designers are not building just pages, they are building ‘views’ and ‘states’. The difference between a page and a state is that a page may have many states. For example, on the simple side, when your mouse is over a button \(known as the rollover state\), someone has to show what this is going to look like. But it also gets a lot more complex because some pages have multiple actions that happen during a click, rollover, after a click. These can be things like notifications to the user, modal boxes \(popups\), and other changes to the ‘view’ of the page based on actions of users. Take a look at the example of the ‘Add new location’ process in the case study below. The entire process with many views and states are on one single ‘page’.

## When a SaaS isn’t easy to use

What this means is that if a system isn’t intuitive to use, for the most part, people won’t use it. Even worse, a lot of times when SaaS users leave, they don’t tell you why they’re leaving. They just don’t renew their subscription, bow out, and disappear into the anonymous gray of the internet. 

That’s not altogether terrible, seeing as how you don’t have to actually deal with them when they’re upset. But when they don’t tell you why they left, what they got frustrated about, or what they didn’t like it means you don’t know how to fix it for other users. Sometimes it’s price, sometimes it’s that they’re not using the system anymore, and very often it’s that they got frustrated about the use of some system because they couldn’t figure it out or it took too long to load and just decided not to use it anymore and left.
