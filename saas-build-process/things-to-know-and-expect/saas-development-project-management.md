# You MUST learn at least the basics of Project Management

## You can't run your business without proper management

Starting a SaaS entails getting things built then marketing and selling the thing you built. Once you're done building the system, your users will be expecting the next feature, the next thing, the next integration, and for you to keep the system up and running. Throughout all of this, you must have a method of getting these things done or you are going to get completely lost in the sea of requests, promises, and the resulting very upset people. 

All of this requires a method, and this has turned into it's own industry. To become a pro takes years of practice and experience. But to understand the basics takes about an hour. 

If you are:

* An entrepreneur starting a SaaS business
* An executive getting a SaaS built for your company
* A developer or designer building a tool system

**THEN YOU MUST HAVE MORE THAN A RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF AGILE DEVELOPMENT!**

**PROTIP:** If you do nothing else, take an hour or two and read the [Atlassian guide to project management](https://www.atlassian.com/project-management). It will be worth it’s time in dollars tenfold, guaranteed. If you don’t have an understanding of project management before going into this process, you are setting yourself up for failure.
