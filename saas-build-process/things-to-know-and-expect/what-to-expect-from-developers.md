# What to expect from developers

Different developers have different levels of skill, experience, accountability, etc. Great developers can be terrible time managers and vice versa. People are not equal in all areas, and getting the right people to do the right job is one of the most challenging aspects of any project.  


A book could be written on what to expect from developers, how they think and what they should and shouldn’t be responsible for, and many have. Rather than going into what to expect from developers, my recommendation is to start by [reading at least the first 3 chapters of “The Mythical Man Month” by Fred Brooks](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959). This will give you a great understand of who you are working with, how they think, and what you should expect from them.
