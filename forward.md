# Forward

I've made a lot of mistakes in business over the last 20 years and learned from most of them. I can’t tell you how to succeed, but I can for sure tell you how not to fail.

I hope these lessons I’ve learned will help you avoid some of the many mistakes I have made and help you to grow a thriving business and make the world a better place. Please, take this knowledge and grow something amazing!
