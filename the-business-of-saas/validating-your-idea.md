# Validating Your Idea

You’ve got to validate your idea and get customers or potential customers to put money in your pocket as soon as possible in order to do so. That’s where the rubber meets the road, and where your success is determined.

To learn to validate your idea the best thing you can do is to read [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.](http://theleanstartup.com/) But since you’re already reading this book and you’re probably going to finish because this book is way more interesting than that book \(he’s actually a better writer than I am, so read his book\), here are the basics of what you need to do.

## **Step 1: My SaaS solves \[STATE PROBLEM HERE\] for \[STATE AS SPECIFIC OF A GROUP AS POSSIBLE HERE\]**

The easier it is for your SaaS to answer this question, the easier it will be to sell, and thus the better chance you’ll have at success. On the flip side of this, the broader the statement and the group, the bigger the budget you’ll need to build and market the product.

Something I’ve seen so many times is an entrepreneur trying to do something that directly competes with monster companies like Facebook or Google. They try to explain how this is different, but inevitably they get crushed by this. So, take an objective look at your system, if you’re trying to do something that could compete with Facebook or Google, you probably are. That said, you can definitely compete with the big players as long as you have the budget to do it.

Facebook brought in about 40 billion dollars in 2017. That is about 3.3 billion dollars per month. Do you have that kind of budget? If so, call me and I will be so happy to help you build your platform. If not, think about specifying your target market or offering a bit more.

Remember that specificity is key in your target market. So many new entrepreneurs I’ve met are hesitant to focus on a particular market because they feel like they are going to lose business. In reality, specifying your market enables you to sell a lot more. When you know exactly who your target is, you know exactly who to call. Besides, after you open this market up, you can always look at an adjacent or similar market.

## Step 2: Reach out to your personal network of people and find a group of advisers who work in this industry or are your target market. Convince them to be on your board.

You’re going to need this group for a few different things.

1. Get feedback on your system.
2. They are your first customers. If you can’t sell them on your product, it’s going to fail.
3. Each person is going to give you a testimonial for your website and marketing.
4. They are going to tell their friends about your product and will jumpstart your sales.
5. They are going to tell you if your idea is any good and if other people are going to buy it.

At a certain point, you’re going to be in a spot where you can confidently say “I know better than this group does about their own market.” But when you’re first starting out, you need this group to guide you. Remember, you’re going to mess things up initially, so make sure that your idea is a hot winner and everyone agrees with you and is clamoring to get your product.

My Grandfather had a great saying about business that directly relates to this. He said “Don’t fall in love with your businesses.” I see this happening all the time where new entrepreneurs fall in love with their idea and are willing to live and die by them. Unfortunately, it is usually more of the latter. Your business is there to make your life better

## Step 3: Make a list of competitors and sign up for their systems.

Pretend you’re a buyer and have them give you demos on their systems, learn how they pitch you on their products, and record the conversation. Throughout the calls you do with your competitors, ask them questions about different scenarios, how they handle different kinds of clients, and why they charge what they charge.

## Step 4: Now that you know your competitors, figure out how you’re different.

What are you offering that they are not, or to what people? It could be that there is just room in the market for someone who does exactly the same thing. It’s fine either way, as long as you know where you stand.

My recommendation is to make a spreadsheet of all your competitors and their products. For each product make a row, and for each feature, a column. Now you can go through and make a list of features and services your competition offers and how you are different. It is a simple exercise, but if you do it, you will see the differences in black and white. Maybe you're a lot different, or maybe you need to think more about what you're building. 

## Step 5: Figure out your pricing model

Plan on spending some time figuring out your pricing model. Since you already signed up for your competitors’ systems, you know how they are pricing. So figuring yours shouldn’t be a big stretch, but it’s still going to take more time than you expect. [There is a whole chapter on pricing](../appraisement-pricing-your-saas/appraisement-saas-pricing.md). I highly recommend you read this section.

## Step 6: Hire a designer to do some basic designs for you so you can pitch it to your advisers and potential customers.

Plan on spending between $1200 and $5000 for a first round of designs. But don’t spend too much, these are going to change a lot once you get feedback. Just get enough design work done to get to the next step. If you’re not used to working with a designer, remember to hire a UX designer who has done this before, and expect for it to take a number of revisions!

## Step 7: Get your advisory group into a room \(physical or virtual\) and ask them all if your solution is going to solve their problems and if the cost is worth it. If the answer is yes, ask them to buy it during the meeting.

If your product is what they need, they know they need it, and the price matches their budget, you’re in the money. But if you designed something that you can’t sell to your group of advisers, you’re going to have a hell of a time selling it to anyone else.

The rubber meets the road where people open up their pocketbooks and give you money. If that is happening, then you are all set.

## Step 8: Double check by asking more questions to more people

By the time you're at this point, you have a list of people who want to make a purchase, a system concept that generally works, and hopefully a lot of enthusiasm. But if the only people that buy your system are sitting in the room with you, then you're probably still not going to make it. 

So what do you do to be sure?

**This is critical:** Ask as many people in your target market as possible. What you find may still surprise you. 

#### Storytime with David: 

David had an idea. He had been spending ten to thirty thousand dollars, per facility per year with consultants to get this data. For all of these years, those consultants were doing work that he _knew_ could be automated. 

It was so easy, just a few simple features; a surveying system to ask questions, a template with all the questions pre-built, some simple systems to enable the survey participants to flow through the survey faster than other systems, and he would have a for-sure sale. He knew the industry, he knew the people. Heck, he was one of them! 

After a 60k investment, a year of work, and more testing and frustration than he could have ever imagined, it was done. Time to take it to market, and he knew exactly where to go. He took the team to the regional association trade show to show off everything he had built. 

Over the course of the tradeshow his heart started to sink.

The system was perfect, it did exactly what he needed it to do. But over the course of three days, he realized that in states across the US other people in his industry didn't want the software, they wanted someone to do the work for them. They _wanted_ the consultants. 

His target market didn't care about the software at all, what they wanted was the service, not the system. They didn't have time to implement the software he had built even if they wanted to. He had built a great system, but in the end, he could run the exact same business by just using the current industry leading survey software system and avoided all the cost of development. 

He realized that what he had built was not an innovative solution to a major problem. He was just a new consulting company to do the same work that all the other consultants were doing, but with less tested and less effective software. 

### How could this have been avoided?

David had gone through most of the aspects of the validation process, but he didn't get in front of a lot of other people and ask them specifically if they could and would use the system.

There are several ways this could have been accomplished. 

#### 1. Go to the tradeshow as an attendee and just ask people if they would buy the system. 

So many people I have spoken to when I recommend something like this say "I can't afford to spend 2k on a tradeshow where I'm not going to make any money!"

My answer is simple. Would you rather spend 2k figuring out if this will work or 50k building something you'll never make a dollar from? 

#### 2. Send a survey

If you don't know your audience, you probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. So, get started with taking a list of people in the industry and asking them all to take a quick survey. You'll want to have some aspects of what you're building ready to view before you do this, but even if you don't you can still ask questions. 

Even if you are entering a new market that you don't know that much about, you could take the following methods to find the people to ask:

1. Join an association and get their members list
2. Do market research and hire a VA \(virtual assistant\) to find email addresses
3. Run some ads on Facebook targeted towards your users and ask them to fill out your survey. You can also offer to compensate them. Just make sure to set up only a limit to the number of people you're going to pay. 

Here are some of the questions that David may have used for his target audience:

1. How do you currently collect local wage and benefits information from the largest local employers?
   1. We don't collect or distribute this data
   2. We have a consultant do this for us
   3. We use state-wide data
   4. We have an in-house person do this for us
2. How often do you collect this data?
   1. More than once a year
   2. Once a year
   3. Every other year
   4. Every three years
   5. Whenever we have time, but more than every 3 years
3. What is the cost of collecting this data?
   1. Free
   2. 1k - 5k
   3. 5k - 10k
   4. 10k - 20k
   5. 20k - 30k
   6. 30k+
4. What are your top frustrations with collecting this information?
   1. Text answer
5. For groups using consultants or in-house staff, what is your process for getting this data?
6. If there was a software system that just required you to send out a pre-built survey and make some followup calls to your industries, would you use it?
7. How much would you pay for this system?
   1. I wouldn't pay for it
   2. Less than 1k per year
   3. 1k - 2.5k per year
   4. 2.5k - 5k per year
   5. 5k - 10k per year
   6. 10k+ per year
8. What system features would you find most valuable? \(put in order of importance\) 
   1. The form would auto-fill last years' answers for industries \(link to video showing how this would work\)
   2. The system would anonymously collect all data and auto-compile it for you.
   3. Integrate with HRI systems to import industry compensation data automatically.
   4. Advanced web-based dashboard specifically built to help industries understand this data.
9. Would you buy this software if I built it?
   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. Maybe \(if maybe, why?\)
10. If yes: if I were to give you 50% off for the first year, knowing the system would be done a year from now, would you be willing to pay for the system now?
    1. Yes
    2. No
11. If yes, would you be willing to do a phone call with me to talk more about this?
    1. Yes - links to calendar scheduling system
    2. No

Think about this simple step for just a minute. An hour of time spent working on this survey and sending it out to friends who would absolutely complete the survey would have saved someone $60,000.00, a year of work, and countless hours of frustration. 

Don't let this be you. Don't be David.

## Step 9: Distribution Validation

If you're building a system that is sold via an enterprise sale, most of your sales are going to be in person or virtual in person via a video call. But if you can't get the decision makers on the line, how will you make the sale? 

If you're selling a more mass marketed system, you need know if you can compete for marketing. If you're selling to a very specific market and you can reach directly out to them, great. But if you're trying to compete for the keyword "Get a Visa Card," good luck with that. 

So you need to validate your distribution and marketing models to some extent as well. 

## Validation Success

What constitutes success in validation? 

1. You can fill in the blanks in the statement "My SaaS solves \[SOLUTION\] for \[SPECIFIC AUDIENCE\]."
2. You have a unique selling proposition, a reason for your customers to buy your product instead of your competitors product.
3. You have thoroughly reviewed all your major competitors products and understand the features of those systems as well as how they sell their systems and to whom. 
4. Your advisers are willing to buy your product at your price.
5. Your expected users have told you that they will buy your product.
6. At least a few users are willing to talk to you about buying your system now or are at least interested in talking about it.
7. Your advisers and other potential buyers have put at least some money in your pocket because they want your system that bad, and not because they feel bad for you. 
8. You

### **Sometimes this process does**n’t apply

But most of the time it does, or at least some variation of this applies. So don’t skimp on it, go through it, take the time, and know your business, or you are going to end up throwing away your time and money.

An example of how this may not apply is if you’re already in the market and fulfilling requested needs of existing customers, or have some inside knowledge about the market. While these situations may mitigate the need to go through this whole process, you will still almost definitely want to go through some aspects of it.
