# Validating Your Idea

You’ve got to validate your idea and get customers or potential customers to put money in your pocket as soon as possible in order to do so. That’s where the rubber meets the road, and where your success is determined.

To learn to validate your idea the best thing you can do is to read [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.](http://theleanstartup.com/) But since you’re already reading this book and you’re probably going to finish because this book is way more interesting than that book \(he’s actually a better writer than I am, so read his book\), here are the basics of what you need to do.

## **Step 1: My SaaS solves \[STATE PROBLEM HERE\] for \[STATE AS SPECIFIC OF A GROUP AS POSSIBLE HERE\]**

The easier it is for your SaaS to answer this question, the easier it will be to sell, and thus the better chance you’ll have at success. On the flip side of this, the broader the statement and the group, the bigger the budget you’ll need to build and market the product.

Something I’ve seen so many times is an entrepreneur trying to do something that directly competes with monster companies like Facebook or Google. They try to explain how this is different, but inevitably they get crushed by this. So, take an objective look at your system, if you’re trying to do something that could compete with Facebook or Google, you probably are. That said, you can definitely compete with the big players as long as you have the budget to do it.

Facebook brought in about 40 billion dollars in 2017. That is about 3.3 billion dollars per month. Do you have that kind of budget? If so, call me and I will be so happy to help you build your platform. If not, think about specifying your target market or offering a bit more.

Remember that specificity is key in your target market. So many new entrepreneurs I’ve met are hesitant to focus on a particular market because they feel like they are going to lose business. In reality, specifying your market enables you to sell a lot more. When you know exactly who your target is, you know exactly who to call. Besides, after you open this market up, you can always look at an adjacent or similar market.

## Step 2: Reach out to your personal network of people and find a group of advisers who work in this industry or are your target market. Convince them to be on your board.

You’re going to need this group for a few different things.

1. Get feedback on your system.
2. They are your first customers. If you can’t sell them on your product, it’s going to fail.
3. Each person is going to give you a testimonial for your website and marketing.
4. They are going to tell their friends about your product and will jumpstart your sales.
5. They are going to tell you if your idea is any good and if other people are going to buy it.

At a certain point, you’re going to be in a spot where you can confidently say “I know better than this group does about their own market.” But when you’re first starting out, you need this group to guide you. Remember, you’re going to mess things up initially, so make sure that your idea is a hot winner and everyone agrees with you and is clamoring to get your product.

My Grandfather had a great saying about business that directly relates to this. He said “Don’t fall in love with your businesses.” I see this happening all the time where new entrepreneurs fall in love with their idea and are willing to live and die by them. Unfortunately, it is usually more of the latter. Your business is there to make your life better

## Step 3: Make a list of competitors and sign up for their systems.

Pretend you’re a buyer and have them give you demos on their systems, learn how they pitch you on their products, and record the conversation. Throughout the calls you do with your competitors, ask them questions about different scenarios, how they handle different kinds of clients, and why they charge what they charge.

## Step 4: Now that you know your competitors, figure out how you’re different.

What are you offering that they are not, or to what people? It could be that there is just room in the market for someone who does exactly the same thing. It’s fine either way, as long as you know where you stand.

My recommendation is to make a spreadsheet of all your competitors and their products. For each product make a row, and for each feature, a column. Now you can go through and make a list of features and services your competition offers and how you are different. It is a simple exercise, but if you do it, you will see the differences in black and white. Maybe you're a lot different, or maybe you need to think more about what you're building. 

## Step 5: Figure out your pricing model

Plan on spending some time figuring out your pricing model. Since you already signed up for your competitors’ systems, you know how they are pricing. So figuring yours shouldn’t be a big stretch, but it’s still going to take more time than you expect. [There is a whole chapter on pricing](../appraisement-pricing-your-saas/appraisement-saas-pricing.md). I highly recommend you read this section.

## Step 6: Hire a designer to do some basic designs for you so you can pitch it to your advisers and potential customers.

Plan on spending between $1200 and $5000 for a first round of designs. But don’t spend too much, these are going to change a lot once you get feedback. Just get enough design work done to get to the next step. If you’re not used to working with a designer, remember to hire a UX designer who has done this before, and expect for it to take a number of revisions!

## Step 7: Get your advisory group into a room \(physical or virtual\) and ask them all if your solution is going to solve their problems and if the cost is worth it. If the answer is yes, ask them to buy it during the meeting.

If your product is what they need, they know they need it, and the price matches their budget, you’re in the money. But if you designed something that you can’t sell to your group of advisers, you’re going to have a hell of a time selling it to anyone else.  


The rubber meets the road where people open up their pocketbooks and give you money. If that is happening, then you are all set.

### **Sometimes this process does**n’t apply

But most of the time it does, or at least some variation of this applies. So don’t skimp on it, go through it, take the time, and know your business, or you are going to end up throwing away your time and money.

An example of how this may not apply is if you’re already in the market and fulfilling requested needs of existing customers, or have some inside knowledge about the market. While these situations may mitigate the need to go through this whole process, you will still almost definitely want to go through some aspects of it.
