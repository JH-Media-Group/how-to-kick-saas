* Build a team
* Develop your system
* Price your system
* Release a MVP
* Acquire customers and keep them from leaving
* Build a community

* Manage the development growth of your system

All of this is necessary to know, but so often the questions come up at this point:  


1. What is my process?
2. Is there a steps I should take now?
3. How do I gain traction?

That’s always the trick isn’t it? You can build the greatest thing in the world, but if no one knows about, it doesn’t do a whole lot of good. So in this chapter, we’re going to walk through the steps you can take to gain traction.  


Important disclaimer! This is a good process. It’s worked for some businesses, but it’s not foolproof, and for every business that has succeeded, there are tons of other businesses that have tried this and failed. [For more on this see one of my first lessons in the book.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.gedzqlmoxd5p) This is a guide to help you get going and grow.  


### The Process

Now that you  


Before we start we need to make some assumptions about where you are. If you started off at the beginning of this book and worked your way though, doing most or all of these recommendations then you:  


1. Already have a few customers that you developed during your validation phase and they are waiting for your launch.
2. Have been working on your SEO for a while by the time you are ready to start really marketing you’re already starting to push up to the first page of Google, if you’re not there already.
3. Have a validated system with a validated customer base.
4. 
--------------------------------------------------  


Before we get into the step by step, here are a couple of the most important things you can do. After this, the process.  


### No one wants to follow you unless other people think you’re important

If you have less than about 20,000 followers on Twitter, no one with 100,000 followers and up is going to take you seriously. The same thing applies to Facebook, LinkedIn, and just about every other social platform. No one who is someone wants to talk to someone who isn’t. Well, at least they don’t want to follow you back.  


Don’t get too upset about this though, there’s a good reason for it. Your popularity on most of these systems is based on the ratio of how many people follow you to how many people you follow, the greater the ratio the better. Once you get to the point where you have tons of followers, you’re not going to want to follow no-name people and businesses back either.  


So here’s the secret.  


Most of these companies got where they are with some dirty tactics. Even the white knights out there wear a little grey hat every now and then. For example, there are a ton of videos out there on Youtube telling you how to grow your subscribers. They have tons of great tips about making sure your videos show on the same day and same time, how to increase watch time and how that helps you, and so much more. But what NO ONE ever says is that they placed a note in their video description or comments that says “Follow this link and I’ll follow your back.” Of course everyone wants someone super popular to follow them, so they become a follower. The next thing no one really sees coming, those guys then unfollow their followers slowly over time. Because remember, their popularity is based on the ratio of how many people follow them to how many people they follow. This is a dirty trick known as an ‘unfollow campaign’. It’s dirty, its gray or black hat, and tons of businesses do it. Clearly, I’m not going to recommend you do this since the penalties can be stiff, but I may know someone who tried this with great success. Just sayin.  


The other way you can become popular is to just produce great content regularly over tons of time and devote lots and lots of time to it, which you should be doing anyway. But if you want a little bump in the beginning, there may be other ways.
