# The Process

## The Path

It's hard to get somewhere if you don't know where you're going, and most SaaS entrepreneurs I know start off for the first many years fumbling blindly through the forest. Some succeed despite themselves, others have assistance from people who have walked or been guided down this path before, but most fail. 

So let me show you your path and outline the skills you'll need to walk that path. 

## Standard SaaS Process steps:

Step by step, the process of developing your SaaS intertwines almost all aspects of business building, software development, customer acquisition and activation, and the aspects of minimizing attrition. Since many of the steps in this process overlap one another, it wouldn't make sense to write the book in order of the steps. 

But clearly, you will need to know your path and how everything fits together. So in this section, I have outlined your process from start to finish and explained the priciples of each area so you know where to start and where to go as you progress through the rest of the chapters.
