# What You Need To Know About Your Customers

### What you need to know to start:

1. Who you are selling to
2. Their needs and pain points
3. How you quantify their interests and needs

When you’re selling a SaaS system, the more quantifiable data you have on each group, the more you can optimize their value, and your profits.

### What you need to know about people:

* Who are they?
* How would you describe each group?
* What features are most important to them?
* Why are they buying from you instead of your competitors?
* What is the price point where each group thinks the system is valuable and worth buying?
* What is your cost to acquire each different group?
* What is the lifetime value of a user in each group?
* What is the monthly recurring revenue from a user each different group?

PROTIP: When you know how much it costs to acquire a new customer in a particular category, how much they’re going to spend with you & how often they churn, you have your formula for success.
