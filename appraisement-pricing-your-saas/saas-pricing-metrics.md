# SaaS Pricing Metrics

## Pricing is the foundational sales point of your SaaS

Your pricing model is the difference between a thriving SaaS and a dead one.

Understanding your people/markets, your presentation, and why you price the way you price is absolutely necessary to your success. If you’re looking at this now and thinking to yourself, I’m more interested in building the thing and marketing it, and I don’t really need to worry about how it’s priced, there is a good chance you’re going to fail. So don’t skip this chapter.

Metrics are how you make decisions. And with the right information, decisions are easy.

## SaaS Growth is based on Customer Lifetime Value Being Greater Than Customer Acquisition Cost

So let’s start out with the most basic aspect of your SaaS business:

Revenue - Cost = Profit.

Simple right? Now let’s take it a step further for your SaaS.

What you’ve got in SaaS is how much it costs to get a new customer, known as the Customer Acquisition Cost \(CAC\) and the Lifetime Value \(LTV\). CAC is how much it’s costing you to get a new customer and LTV is how much you’re making on that customer. It is very similar to the formula outlined above, just defining “revenue” further.
