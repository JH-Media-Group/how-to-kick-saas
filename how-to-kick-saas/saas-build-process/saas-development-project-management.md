# SaaS Development Project Management

If you are:

* An entrepreneur starting a SaaS business
* An executive getting a SaaS built for your company
* A developer or designer building a tool system

Then the first and one of the best things you can do for yourself is to take a course on [Project Management. ](https://atlassian.com/agile)

If you’re going to do this, **YOU MUST HAVE MORE THAN A RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF AGILE DEVELOPMENT**.

**PROTIP**

If you do nothing else, take an hour or two and read the [Atlassian guide to project management](https://www.atlassian.com/project-management). It will be worth it’s time in dollars tenfold, guaranteed. If you don’t have an understanding of project management before going into this process, you are setting yourself up for failure.
