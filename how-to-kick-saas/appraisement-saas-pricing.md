# Appraisement: SaaS Pricing

SaaS pricing is one of the most important aspects of building your system, and the one that most businesses spend the least amount of time focusing on. So many SaaS entrepreneurs I’ve worked with or spoken to put together their pricing over the course of a day and never change it afterward for fear that someone will get upset.  


So my question to them is, “How do you know you got it right?!”  


It’s a super important question, and one that could lead to the growth or death of a SaaS company!  


Why spend all the time and money on a SaaS system if no one is going to buy it? Also, if you’re not able to scale because or are losing money because your prices are too low, then you can’t provide the best value to your customers.  


Finding the right pricing system is what enables you to live the best life and provide the best value to your customers.  


PROTIP: This area will walk you through the basics of what you need to know to price your SaaS, but what you really need to do is read the Price Intelligently SaaS Pricing Strategy book. This is one of the best and most important documents you can read before you start, during the build, or during the growth and scaling of your SaaS business. READ THE BOOK.

### SaaS Pricing Metrics

#### Pricing is the foundational sales point of your SaaS

Your pricing model is the difference between a thriving SaaS and a dead one.  


Understanding your people/markets, your presentation, and why you price the way you price is absolutely necessary to your success. If you’re looking at this now and thinking to yourself, I’m more interested in building the thing and marketing it, and I don’t really need to worry about how it’s priced, there is a good chance you’re going to fail. So don’t skip this chapter.  


Metrics are how you make decisions. And with the right information, decisions are easy.  


#### SaaS Growth is based on Customer Lifetime Value Being Greater Than Customer Acquisition Cost

So let’s start out with the most basic aspect of your SaaS business:  


Revenue - Cost = Profit.  


Simple right? Now let’s take it a step further for your SaaS.  


What you’ve got in SaaS is how much it costs to get a new customer, known as the Customer Acquisition Cost \(CAC\) and the Lifetime Value \(LTV\). CAC is how much it’s costing you to get a new customer and LTV is how much you’re making on that customer. It is very similar to the formula outlined above, just defining “revenue” further.  


### SaaS Metrics Glossary

Before we go any further, let’s break down the basic concepts and acronyms we’re using.  


This is not a complete glossary of Growth Metrics, just the ‘What you absolutely need to know’ list. For a full list, check out the reading in the [ProfitWell Learning Center](https://learn.profitwell.com/l/en). Also take a look at this article on [Medium to see how other SaaS systems pitched or presented their metrics](https://medium.com/collectops/saas-startup-average-monthly-revenue-and-growth-rate-82eab2109657).

Annual Recurring Revenue \(ARR\)

This is how much revenue you are generating on a recurring basis each year. This is not the same as your monthly recurring revenue because you may have customers who have purchased annual or lifetime memberships to your SaaS or discounts you offered during the year. These kinds of variations make it important to note ARR as well as MRR.  


ARR = Total revenue in a year that is expected to renew the following year.

Average Revenue Per User

This gives you the amount the average user is worth in revenue. This could be by any amount of time, but is often calculated per month. This is a [great article on ARPU](https://learn.profitwell.com/l/en/article/5p6WEspQR6-arpu) and how to use this metric.  


ARPU = Total revenue for time period / Total number for time period

Churn Rate

This is also known as attrition, stated in the 3 A’s of SaaS. This is the annual rate at which your user stop using your service, or churn. Churn rate helps you determine the lifetime value \(LTV\) of a customer. Churn rate is an important factor for many reasons. Understanding what is causing a high churn rate and how to reduce that churn is very important to growing your SaaS.  


When churn rate is positive, it means you’re losing customers. However, churn can become negative as well. This essentially means you have a money machine since you aren’t losing any customers, but instead are just gaining them. That means that for every dollar you spend on your SaaS, you make much more.  


Churn rate = \# of customers who left / total number of customers

Customer Acquisition Cost \(CAC\):

The cost of acquiring a new customer. This price is different for different kinds of customers. Very often, but not all the time, the cost of acquiring a customer that pays you more money or has a higher lifetime value \(LTV\) is higher.  


CAC = Total Cost of Marketing & Sales / \# of Customers Acquired  


You can also break this down into channels by determining the number of customers acquired by, say, outbound campaigns, divided by the number of customers acquired with that method.

Growth

The total total amount of new subscription revenue from new and existing users in a given month. For growth, you also have to take into account your churn rate.  


Growth = New subscriptions + upgrades - churn  


Month over Month Growth Rate \(MoM or M/M\)

This the growth of this month over the previous month.  


MoM = \(Current month total revenue / Last month total revenue\) - 1

Lifetime Value \(LTV\):

This is how much money you will make from a customer from the time they signup and pay their first bill until the end of that customers lifecycle with your business. The problem with this metric can swing drastically based on retention. That means that if your retention drops quickly, your LTV can drop as well, even though they may come back the next month. So it’s important to understand that this metric is not always accurate. It will give you a good idea you can work with, but you need to understand how it swings. You could work a smoothing variable into this formula, but we’re going to keep it simple for this book.  


LTV = Average Revenue Per User \(ARPU\) / Churn Rate to date  


Or in other words:  


LTV = \(Total revenue to date / Total number of users to date\) / \(\# of customers who left / total number of customers\)

Monthly Recurring Revenue \(MRR\)

How much total money you have coming in from subscriptions each month. This is measured per month, so if you are growing, your MRR this month should be higher than last month.  


MRR = Amount of recurring revenue from the most recent month

Value Metric

This is the item or items that you are selling that scale with your customer’s needs. The most common value metric is the number of users. So as the number of users in the system goes up, so does the price. The value metric needs to increase along with the value of the system to your target user. There can be multiple value metrics for a SaaS that scale with different kinds of users.

### SaaS pricing isn’t rocket science, but it is science

In SaaS, pricing is part your marketing, your sales, your system, your upgrades, your conversations, your growth, and your happiness within the business. In some ways, it is the business.  


Your pricing model should be based on a [scientific model of evidence based decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), and the people that are going to give you the answers to those decisions are your customers. If you’re not talking to them, you’re not doing your job.

### Pricing Aspects in SaaS

There are a number of techniques noted in the [SaaS Pricing Strategy](https://www.priceintelligently.com/developing-your-saas-pricing-strategy) book that outline what questions to ask your customers to determine their:

* Willingness to pay
* Interest in different features
* Interest in different kinds of pricing models

As well as what price points create the most sales vs. the most revenue. The SaaS Pricing Strategy book does rely exclusively on the the economist [Van Westendorp’s Price Sensitivity Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter), which is a great place to start. But there are also [counter-arguments to this method](http://mmrstrategy.com/why-you-should-almost-never-use-the-van-westendorp-pricing-model/), which I think are valid.  


#### Price Sensitivity Meter Questions

There are four questions from Van Westendorp’s Price Sensitivity meter:  


* At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive it is not worth buying? \(too expensive\)
* At what price would you consider the product starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? \(Expensive/high\)
* At what price would you consider the product to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good \(too cheap\)
* At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain - a great buy for the money? \(cheap/good value\)

Rather than delving into how to ask these questions the right way, how to find the right price for your company, and why that price may or may not be right, it would be better if you just read the books I mentioned on SaaS pricing already. They do a great job of exploring this concept.  


Especially if you’re sell at the enterprise level, I highly recommend one of my favorite short reads on value-based selling [Breaking the Time Barrier](https://www.freshbooks.com/assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf), by Mike McDerment the founder and CEO of [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/). He also happens to be a really nice guy who randomly took me out to lunch one day and schooled me hard on the differences between small business and enterprise accounting systems. But that’s another story.  


#### Methods of SaaS Pricing

What [Breaking the Time Barrier](https://www.freshbooks.com/assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf) delves into is the difference between [value-based pricing vs. time-based pricing](https://www.brainleaf.com/blog/running-a-business/value-based-pricing-vs-cost-based-pricing-in-web-and-app-development/) for agencies. If I was going to wrap the book up into a few words it would be “If you are selling something in a market where the price can be based on the value you provide for your customers or clients, base your pricing on this.” This is also what is recommended in the book noted at the start of this chapter, [SaaS Pricing Strategy](https://www.priceintelligently.com/developing-your-saas-pricing-strategy) by Price Intelligently.  


What this means is that you are providing value to your customers, so your price should reflect the value you provide. There are other ways to price, noted in both of those books, such as cost-plus pricing \(take your cost and add a margin to it\) and competitor-based pricing \(figure out what your competitors are charging and charge something close\). The point is, if you are providing something that is exactly  the same as what someone else is providing, they are probably going to just go with the other company.  


So figure out how you are different and set your price based on how much money you’re making or saving that client, not on how much it costs you or what your competition is doing.

### What you need to know about your customers

What you need to know to start:  


1. Who you are selling to
2. Their needs and pain points
3. How you quantify their interests and needs

When you’re selling a SaaS system, the more quantifiable data you have on each group, the more you can optimize their value, and your profits.  


What you need to know about people:  


* Who are they?
* How would you describe each group?
* What features are most important to them?
* Why are they buying from you instead of your competitors?
* What is the price point where each group thinks the system is valuable and worth buying?
* What is your cost to acquire each different group?
* What is the lifetime value of a user in each group?
* What is the monthly recurring revenue from a user each different group?

When you know how much it costs to acquire a new customer in a particular category, how much they’re going to spend with you & how often they churn, you have your formula for success.  


### How to price your SaaS system

#### Basic steps to optimizing your Average Revenue Per User \(ARPU\):

Step 1: Who are you selling to?

Remember lesson 1 in [validating your system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.pml1kcfeyb5j)? Here is another place that lesson comes in. If you don’t know who you’re selling to, then you didn’t do your homework in the first place. Go directly to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200. But I have a feeling if you’ve read this far, you probably know who you’re selling to, or at least have some idea. Now take all the groups you’ve got and segment them in three to five different major groups.

Step 2: Identify the demographics of the groups that will pay the most and get the most value from your SaaS offering.

These are your highest value customers.  


What you need to know for each group you’re selling to is:

1. Type of company
2. Company industry
3. Role, position, or title

If possible, get as much info as you can. Information such as:

1. Age range
2. Income range
3. Male / Female ratio
4. Interests
5. Level of computer savviness
6. Education level
7. Anything else relevant to selling your SaaS

Building a customer profile can be very quick or very difficult depending on your product. If you did your validation, you should have this already. But if you’re looking at this area with crossed eyes and thinking to yourself “How and I going to do that?” Then here are your steps:  


1. Start with who isn’t using your system. This part is easier since there are a ton of people that aren’t ever going to use your system. For example, people that don’t use the internet are never going to use your system. Sounds silly, but I can’t tell you how many times I have brought up to clients that some of their potential customers will not benefit at all from their digital marketing efforts as they never use the internet.
2. Next, work out your group’s expected professions. In some cases this is simple, whereas in others it is really tough. After a number of Google queries and perhaps a bit of reading in some scholarly articles, you can usually identify some trends.
3. Now that you have a somewhat more narrowed field of users, identify your expected male to female ratio and expected ages of your users as well as their income. A lot of time this is a very telling item. You can often just enter your query into Google to figure this one out, but then sometimes you also need to do some deeper digging.
4. From here, you need to infer some traits of these people. If you suspect someone’s age, income, male to female ratio, and their profession, then you can probably figure out a lot more about them and will now have some ideas about their motivations, your real competition, and much more.

Step 3: Determine Most Valued Features

This is what you’re different customer groups are actually buying.  


For each group, there will be a different set of features people want. Of course there will be overlap, but different people’s roles in a business determine what aspects of your SaaS they are more or less interested in and value the most. For example, a CEO is going to be more interested in reporting than a caller at a call center. Conversely, the caller is going to be a lot more interested, relatively speaking, in the speed of the system than the CEO.  


So now list out which features you think each group is most interested in. That’s a great start, but the only person who is actually going to tell you what features they’re interested in are the users themselves. Now it’s time to actually ask them what they think! Put together a survey and send it out to everyone.  


Don’t have users yet? That’s what that [advisory board is going to help you understand](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.amc9hmutfksq).

Step 4: What’s it worth to each group?

Just like the last question, the only person who’s going to tell you how much they will actually pay is the customer. However, at least [we know what questions to ask them to get a good starting point](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.2l79hir37nrt) on each price point.

So just like the last question, you’re either going to be sending out surveys to everyone, or asking that advisory board for some help with this. If you’re just getting started and using your advisory board, remember that this is a very, very small sample size and different regions around the country and around the world have very, very different values they place on systems.  


If you’re not using the advisory board, make sure the take a look at the [Van Westendorp’s Price Sensitivity Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter) for a list of questions to ask all your users.

### Customer Types Example: BrainLeaf

In your SaaS, there’s a very high chance that different customer types have different needs. For example, let’s take a look at our project scoping tool, BrainLeaf. This is a tool that enables users to find example templates of website information architectures \(filling the knowledge gap\), write out new website project information architectures quickly, and get digital signatures quickly and easily \(filling the efficiency gap\).

#### The Freelancer

But let’s say that the buyer isn’t an agency, it’s a freelancer. What are they interested in? The reporting or the thoroughness of the document? The answer is, probably neither. They want speed and templates and a price on the system they can afford so they can do their job faster and make more money.  


| Type of company or Industry | Marketing |
| :--- | :--- |
| Size of company | 1 - small business |
| Title / Role | Creative Director |
| Valued Features | Pre-built templates and contracts |
| Willingness to pay / acceptable price:  | Low, they don’t have much to spend. $0 - $10/mo |
| Number of Customers | 125 |

#### Small Agency Owner

The owner of the digital agency is more interested in financial reporting on the profitability of the company as a whole, so reporting to them is a lot more important than the minutia of each project.  


| Type of company or Industry | Development-focused digital agency |
| :--- | :--- |
| Size of company | 11 - small business |
| Title / Role | Founder & CEO |
| Valued Features | Sales process management and per project profitability reporting |
| Willingness to pay / acceptable price:  | Medium willingness to pay. $75/mo |
| Number of Customers | 255 |

#### Mid-Sized Digital Agency COO

The COO of a mid-sized agency is more interested in financial reporting on the profitability of the company as a whole, so reporting to them is a lot more important than the minutia of each project.  


| Type of company or Industry | Full-service digital agency |
| :--- | :--- |
| Size of company | 52 - small business |
| Title / Role | COO |
| Valued Features | Business operations streamlining, sales reporting, exporting data to spreadsheets for analysis |
| Willingness to pay / acceptable price:  | Medium willingness to pay. $250/mo |
| Number of Customers | 90 |

#### Large Agency Project Manager

A project manager in a large digital agency using our system is a lot more interested in ensuring that their scope document is written correctly, their clients have given approval at every step, and that the people doing the work in a project understand what they are supposed to do. One slip-up could easily cost the company thousands of dollars, so the value of the system is high to this user.  


| Type of company or Industry | Digital Marketing / Web-design |
| :--- | :--- |
| Size of company | 500 - mid-sized business |
| Title / Role | Project Manager / Account Manager |
| Valued Features | Client approval management, team collaboration |
| Willingness to pay / acceptable price:  | High willingness to pay. $300+/mo |
| Number of Customers | 25 |

#### Enterprise CTO

This buyer needs to better understand the cost of solving issues and needs better reporting and process management.  


| Type of company or Industry | Enterprise |
| :--- | :--- |
| Size of company | Enterprise - 14,000 |
| Title / Role | CTO |
| Valued Features | Cost per development task estimation |
| Willingness to pay / acceptable price:  | High willingness to pay. $8,000+/mo |
| Number of Customers | 1 |

As you can see, value is different for different groups, and so is the value they get from the system.

PROTIP: Knowing your target markets = knowing how you deliver value

The more you know about each of these groups, insofar as what they want from your system, how much they are willing to pay, and what their buying style is, the faster you can test your hypothesis and implement more profitable pricing and optimize value for your customers.  


### In-Depth Analysis on SaaS Groups

Before we can figure out who is the most valuable and how we’re going to sell to them, we need a few more pieces of data for each type of customer.  Per customer type, if we have ARPU, MRR, Churn Rate, CAC, and LTV, we can figure out who we should really be selling to. Let’s take a look:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UR_GzG8kAd4JnT5McliXCnEQusryCJ8bJedXomPRYPHBhDlqHdngAV5pJADzsRkPxzu_pe-9NKBY4tpsIFeybCNdTEXiK4gKgMA9V2-w0l8FcbDaZJpxPnfEmPdQYebQWL5-E2p)

Now that we have the numbers and a little analysis, things look different.  


Please keep in mind that a ton of analysis could be done on this data along with other aspects of this data that are not shown here. The goal here is to give you a taste of what you could find, not go deep into this area.  


#### Freelancers Analysis

This group has by far the most questions and the most problems, they require the most handholding, and call us the most. Because we deal with them the most, we thought that these were our biggest customer group. Turns out, we are wasting our time and money dealing with them!  


They have a LTV:CAC of 1 to 1, so if we were to have focused on that group, which had certainly come up in discussions, we would have been in a really bad spot and the business would have failed.  


Our ideas to change this LTV to CAC were:

Increase price:

By increasing the price, we will increase our LTV. We would fit a smaller group of this segment, but they are losing us money anyway.

Cut Support:

Finding ways to cut support time for this group would cut our time working with them and thus our ongoing spend with a group that is not helping us grow.

Lower CAC:

First off, we could modify our PPC to come off of this group all together so we can lower our CAC. But then also cut our calls to users in this group. We were following up with phone calls to this group, which was a relatively large cost. But with this new data, it looks like a good idea to cut this expense.  


Storytime with Brennan:

At a certain point, I had the opportunity to meet with [Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/) after he gave a great lecture on where the internet was going next in digital marketing. I had chosen that lecture at the conference because I wanted to know what he had to say, but also because I wanted to talk to him about his previous venture, Planscope.io, and what happened to it. What he told me was right in line with our findings here.  


I approached him after his talk, and introduced myself. I told him that my SaaS was a competitor of his and asked why he had sold Planscope.  


The lessons he gave in that five minute chat were critical to the success of the system moving forward. He said:  


1. With that system, I built a tool that solved a problem the way I solved it. But that doesn’t mean that everyone out there solves the problem like that. So I had to help people understand why they needed to solve the problem like this.
2. Next, because we were focusing on the freelancer market, we were dealing with people that didn’t know they had the problem until it burned them and then they were out of the market.
3. The freelancer market has a ton of churn. You have a high cost of acquisition, then people leave the market for full time jobs all the time. So as soon as you get someone, they are gone.
4. Finally, I built a tool when I should have built an audience. Had I done a better job of building a following that focuses on why scoping is important, it would have been more effective than building a tool. The tool should have been the last thing I did, not the first.

Somewhere in the middle of that conversation I found myself wishing that I had reached out to him so long ago. I might not have ever gone down the path of building the thing had I realized the issues. But there I was, and now I understood more about what I needed to do to get this thing going. Unfortunately, it was still quite a while until I could understand what metrics I needed to monitor and how to analyse them.  


#### Small Agency Owner Analysis

This group provides our highest MRR, but we can see now that the churn on this group is higher than we would like. So our immediate issue is to figure out how to lower that churn. This group falls partially into the value proposition of the previous group in that they are looking for templates as well as their main value which is more on the sales and management systems. So what do we do?  


Decrease Churn

We are at a 5 to 1 LTV to CAC, but it could be so much better if we could lower the churn rate.  By creating a new onboarding process for this group we could probably decrease churn right away. This group and the freelancers were getting basically the same onboarding process starting from a phone call, but if we were to improve users’ education as to how the system helps them at the beginning of the process and then follow it up with more specific onboarding emails, we could potentially decrease churn.  


Let’s look at what the impact would be for this:

* Right now, we have a LTV of $937 for this group. That is ARPU / Churn, so $75/.08 = $937.
* For this group as a whole that means a group LTV of:
  * 56% \(this is the percentage of customers\) of 500 = 280 users in this group
  * Times the LTV for this group of $937 equals $262,369

But what if we could take the churn down to 6%? That would be a new LTV of $1,250. So by doing this, our outcome could look something like this:

* Old group LTV: $262,369
* New group LTV: $350,000 \(with LTV of $1,250\)

That is a difference of $87,631 or roughly an increase in group revenue by A THIRD!  


#### Mid-Sized Digital Agency COO Analysis

These sales are brought in by a professional salesperson that approaches these companies and pitches them on the system, thus the substantially higher CAC. We are at a 5 to 1 ratio for this group, and after an analysis, and especially compared to the next group, it looks like a lot could be done to improve here.  


The churn rate here isn’t bad compared to other churn rates for this company, but what would happen if we brought it down by one point? Well, since it is a 3% churn, a decrease of 1% would thus bring our LTV from $8,333 up to $12,500!  


This group also values the data analysis and operations streamlining, which is a powerful aspect of the system, but like all powerful tools incurs a learning curve and substantial change costs from existing systems. So we have to find companies that are at the right spot for this system to be implemented. We could also improve some aspects of this portion of the system to better compete with enterprise systems that do similar things. This is probably the one of the top items that could be improved to garner more sales in this area.  


Decreasing Churn & Improve Feature Development

Given the CAC and the overall LTV on these customers, the consideration is to add a new role to cater to this group and improve overall customer success. This role will focus on this group’s success by:

* Forming an advisory board and private Facebook Group of top users in this segment.
* Gathering specific user needs.
* Pitching new features to this group
* Providing personal tutorials for this group on how best to use the system.

Additionally, the idea was pitched to do a “Done For You” option for select users in this group; we provide an analysis of their data for them in order to help their businesses while simultaneously providing ourselves a deeper understanding of their needs.  


#### Large Agency Project Manager Analysis

Turns out, this is our best customer! Before we did our analysis, we had no idea!  


This one is, once again, a sales issue. Due to circumstances, this group is being catered to very well, and their pricing is looking pretty good. All we feel we need here is more customers.  


All these customers were acquired at the same time at one event. We did a really great talk at a project management conference that was heavily attended by larger companies. We had one user who had been a believer in the system from the very beginning who is well known in the industry and came up on stage after our talk and personally endorsed us. That day, we took a huge step forward with this group and focused on them heavily.  


But, moving forward, we had a lot of irons in the fire and started getting a lot of freelance and marketing customers. Also, the conference moved to the other side of the country the following year, so we didn’t go back. Dumb, right? The second year, we were super busy and thought that we were doing so well that it didn’t matter. Well, after this analysis, we can see it really did matter.  


Increase Sales

As you would expect, the answer to this one is ‘smack-you-in-the-face simple’: just go back to the conference and give more talks. We’ve already bought our tickets and are applying to speak again. In addition, we are looking for more conferences that would fit into this strategy.

#### Enterprise CTO Analysis

As you can probably tell from the numbers, we only have one client like this. This client is a friend, someone we’ve known for a long time who saw the value in what we’re doing. We worked a lot with his company to make sure they were happy, and put a lot of energy into keeping him happy. We have some attrition counted on this account because we have had different departments come off of the system and others come on, but the company as a whole is the only enterprise company we’ve got.

PROTIP: Enterprise sales, from my experience, is very, very different from small business sales. Being effective at enterprise sales means that you have someone who knows the people in the industry and can just make a phone call to get in touch with them. When you’re selling enterprise products, if you are selling at the right price, it is worth every penny to get someone who knows everyone, despite their high price.

Because we don’t have much experience in enterprise sales, and because our sales were growing in other areas, we didn’t dig into this area at all. However, now that we see the LTV’s of every group, we see that this group has an LTV greater than the next highest group by a factor of more than 5! That is a huge jump!  


Given what goes into getting these kinds of customers, this is a sales problem. We just have to figure out if we have enough revenue to bring on an enterprise sales person and support them through their longer sales cycles. At this point, we are a bit nervous to redirect energy in that direction, but given the LTV on this kind of customer it looks like it may be a good choice.  


#### Who is the most valuable customer?

This was the question we initially sought answer, but as you can see there is no one most valuable group. They all impact our bottom lines in different ways and all contribute in one way or another to the end goal of providing the best value.  


This analysis also highlights the importance of continuous testing and shows how the system is never ‘done’. As soon as we make the changes noted above, we’re going to have to redo the analysis again and make more changes based on that.  


You can see now how this kind of system is never going to be a truly ‘passive’ income system as some people would have you believe, if you want to optimize your earnings. It’s a journey and every step is always followed by another step.  
  


### Putting It All Together:

Now that you know how to determine who you’re selling to, organize them up, what each group is willing to pay, and how your metrics all work together, now it’s time to present them with your pricing!

### SaaS Monthly vs. Annual Pricing

Now that you see the different aspects of pricing and the strategies different companies use to value their systems, you can also see when it becomes beneficial to price annually instead of monthly. It is all a part of the overall Acquisition, Appraisement, and Attrition/Retention strategy for that particular company and their customers.  


Very often, it is more valuable to drive a particular group or all users towards an annual plan. This does a lot of things, but on in particular is that it cuts attrition. If all you sell is an annual plan for a particular group, they cannot churn for at least a year. There are a lot of reasons why you may want to consider going towards annual pricing in your SaaS.
