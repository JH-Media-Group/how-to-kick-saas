# Social Media Marketing

The mistake people make when starting to use social media marketing is to just use one channel. The trick is to use everything together and reinforce with social media marketing. Just doing an ad on Facebook is equivalent to walking into a bar and asking a random girl \(or guy\) out. If you’re really good looking, they are single, you said the right things fast, etc. you might have a chance. Maybe. But probably not.  


However, if they had heard of you, knew you from highschool or college, you had friends that connected you, played the same sports, and like a number of the same things you would have a much better chance. It also helps to be good looking, so make sure you’ve got a good designer on your team!  


#### What you can do with social media

Many things. This includes retweeting cat pics, getting schooled by Nassim Taleb, and, of course, being offensive towards people with different points of view. But none of these things are useful to your software business.  


What is useful for your software business, though, is this: using social media to build a brand, and filling your sales funnel. Build your brand to get customers to trust you, and use your followers’ attention to explain how you solve their problem.

#### Build an image

Think about what you do when you look at the social profiles of a software vendor you’re about to pay money to. You probably want their LinkedIn profile to mention the number of employees they have. You probably enjoy seeing that their most recent tweet was 6 hours ago and not multiple weeks ago. I’m sure you’d rather buy from a company that has some relevant recent Facebook posts rather than the one that has a Facebook profile but has never taken proper care of it.

#### Fill your funnel

With social media you can build a process to attract followers, then select the from them the people that have the problem you can solve, and convince them that your software is the solution.  


How do you do it? By sharing relevant information on the social networks. This can include:  


* Publishing the articles from your blog, as a one-off post or in a constant recurrence.
* Providing technical support.
* Announcing a launch of a new product.

As a SaaS business you can do a few cool things that other kinds of businesses cannot do on social media:  


* Talk about releases and updates. Your product is constantly improving, and you can let the customers know that’s the case.
* If you are offering a free tier in your software or if you have a free trial, you can show your followers where to find it.

#### Why social media attention doesn’t equal revenue

Social media is not a place where people go to buy software. It’s a place where people read stuff to fill their time. The quality of attention your posts get on social media is quite bad. Each post will at best get a few seconds of distracted scanning before your follower moves on to the next item on their timeline.  


What you should do is use that distracted attention to pique the interest of your prospective customer base, remind them that your product exists, and maybe offer them something that will their day a little bit better.

#### Building familiarity with retargeting ads

Retargeting ads are the bread and butter of SaaS marketing — basically showing social media ads to people who have visited your website before.

Retargeting is powerful for two reasons.  


First, you start with a list of customers that have already displayed some kind of intent with your product. Therefore their interest level is higher than that of customers that haven’t heard of you before, and more customers from a retargeting list will find your ad interesting and will click on it.  


Second, seeing ads repeatedly builds familiarity. For someone who has been on your website before, seeing your ad can remind them about that webinar you talked about in your blog, or the free trial that would be just enough to accomplish a work task.

#### Why retargeting ads are “cheaper” than regular ads on the same platform

Well, technically they aren’t cheaper per impression. Your ads will still compete with other people’s ads for placement, and unless you change the targeting the price per impression will likely be the same.  


However, now that you are showing the ads to people who have already visited your website, so know what your SaaS is about, the same amount of impressions will get you more clicks and conversions. The cost per conversion will go down dramatically compared to “cold” traffic.  


So if you are paying $20 per conversion, on regular ad campaigns, the retargeting campaigns can generate conversions at $2 or $3.

#### How retargeting works

To set up a retargeting campaign you need a way to identify specific people you want to market to on a social network. The most common way to get this is to set up a tracking pixel that the social platform provides  


The Facebook pixel, for example, fires a request to Facebook every time someone who is a Facebook user visits your website. There are almost 2B users of Facebook, so there is a high chance that your website visitor is on Facebook. If your visitor is indeed a Facebook user they will get added to a list which you can later use for ad campaigns. The Twitter website tag and the LinkedIn Insight Tag work the same way.  


Once you have a list of people who have visited your website before you can market directly to them. You can also use that list to generate other lists of people with similar interests — for example via Facebook’s Lookalike Audiences.

#### Retargeting and GDPR

Running retargeting campaigns is generally OK for GDPR, provided that:  


* You have a cookie disclaimer on your website that allows website visitors to decline the cookies.
* You are not building lists without explicit authorisation, for example by scraping websites for email addresses or by copying the email addresses from your business cards.

Building retargeting audiences from existing customer lists

All major social platforms allow you to upload your customer email addresses which they will match with people’s social profiles on their side. You might want to segment your retargeting audiences, for example have one for everyone who signed up for a free trial but didn’t convert to a paid plan, one for people that you’re trying to push to a higher-cost tier, and one for website visitors that haven’t signed up yet.

#### Multi-channel retargeting

It’s totally fine \(and a good idea\) to have multiple retargeting pixels from different social platforms on your website. Going overboard on those \(say 20+\) might slow down your landing page, but if you do it reasonably you can be building retargeting audiences on multiple social platforms at once. This in turn allows you to show the same ads to the same people on many websites and increases your chances of getting noticed.

#### Testing your social media ads: creative, targeting, offer

On social media, showing an ad is very affordable compared to, say, a TV commercial or a newspaper ad. Your ads also generally include more than just text like they do on AdWords: images, links, video content. On most social media platforms your ad campaigns consist of:  


1. The creative. This is the image, the text on the ad, the video content.
2. The targeting. How you define your audience for a specific ad campaign makes a big difference in the outcome.
3. The offer. Each ad asks people who see it to do something. What exactly do you ask them to do? Are you asking them to sign up for your email list? Or to buy your product at full price? Or get a 50% discount?

With multiple variables at play and with a low cost for running an ad, social media is a perfect place for testing your ads. Start with a number of variations of different parts of the creative, for example 5 ad headlines and 5 images, build ads with each combination of the text and the image, and see if there are any ads that perform better than others. A lifetime budget of $100 per variation and a few days of time are generally enough to show the winner.  


Once you’ve nailed a few images and headlines try different variations of the offer. Different creatives and offers will resonate differently with each audience you run the ads for, so if you tweak the audience in some cases you might need to test a few variations of the ads again.

#### The structure of the offer

You can put different offers on ads, and they will get different levels of traction. For the same audience, you can expect the conversion rate for a sale to be much lower than the conversion rate for a website visit. Why? Because paying someone money requires way more intent and trust than just visiting someone’s website.  


Let’s suppose that you have two offers: one is to sign up for a free trial of your software, and one is for a newsletter sign-up. The free trial offer converts at 0.05%, so out of 10,000 people who see your ad 5 will sign up for a free trial. Let’s also suppose that you’ve spent $1000 running those ads. So your cost of sale is the total of the ad spend divided by the number of people who signed up for a trial as a result of your ad campaign, so $200 / trial sign-up.  


Imagine that the users who sign up for your free trial generally convert at a 3% rate to paid customers, and the average lifetime value of every paid customer for you is $800.

So if you use the Facebook ad above to acquire free trial users, the paid users that come out of those free trials will cost you the trial sign-up divided by the trial -&gt; paid conversion rate for each paid customer:  


\( $200 / trial sign-up \) / \( 3% trial -&gt; paid conversion rate \) = $6,667 / paid sign-up.  


So you would be paying $6,667 for each customer that would bring you $800. This isn’t a viable business.  


Now, let’s assume that you are using the ads to drive sign-ups for your email newsletter. The ad offers the user to download a cool PDF ebook and sign them up for your newsletter.  


You also spend $1,000 on running the ads, but now the ask is smaller, and you also have a compelling offer — a PDF ebook looks interesting and useful. So the conversion rate goes up from 0.05% to 2%, and out of 10,000 people who see your ad 200 people will download the ebook sign up for your newsletter.  


Let’s also assume that you are doing a great job at email marketing, and your newsletter sign-up -&gt; free trial conversion rate is 10%. From the 200 people who signed up for the newsletter, 20 will sign up for a free trial. The email marketing sequence also explains how to use your product, and users can get more out of their free trial. The free trial -&gt; paid conversion rate jumps to 10% for people who received your email sequence. 20 free trials, 10% trial -&gt; paid rate, so at the very end of the funnel you get 2 paid users. Each will bring you $800 of lifetime value.

In this second case with the email marketing sequence in between the ad and your SaaS you have paid $1,000 to acquire $1,600 in revenue. You can keep the difference of $600 as profit.

By changing the offer and adding another piece to the funnel you have dramatically improved the math on your social media ads.

Webinars as the offer

Webinars are a great way to educate your potential customers about your software. It’s like answering everyone’s questions on a video call, but with a hundred people at a time.  


The webinars are much more scalable ways to address people’s questions than one-on-one sales calls. It is much lower-commitment than getting on the phone with you, and if you do it right it can be no less engaging for the prospective customer. So more prospective customers will show up, and you’ll feel better about your time as you’ve been talking to many people at the same time.  


The best part about webinars: they can be recorded. The recordings of webinars make a great offer to put on social media ads. It’s valuable enough that your prospective customers would trade their email address for it, and at the same time very scalable as you can use the same recording on hundreds of ads across all social media platforms.

If you are showing ads to people that haven’t heard of you before you might not have much success getting people to see a webinar. A better way could be to get them to visit your website, or get your PDF e-book on a topic relevant to your product, after which you can “upsell” them to a webinar registration.

### Social media ad tricks

I want to share some tricks for using social media that we learned with BrainLeaf.

#### Use pictures of your UI in the ad creative

Seeing the pictures of your UI on the ads makes people want to see your product in action. Your UI is likely much more modern than the software your prospects are using today, and seeing a slick UI increases the curiosity about your product.

#### Take advantage of your customer’s social media posts about your product

If your customers are so excited about your product that they are tweeting about it, make sure to get their message to all your followers. If the customer profile is right the customers that talk about you positively on social media can be good candidates for case studies.

Provide support via social media

If is it sustainable, try answering customer questions on Twitter or Facebook. It’s a great customer experience, the customers are likely to share your social media profile if you help them out, and the answers don’t go anywhere and eventually start ranking in Google.

#### What social media is right and not right for?

In my experience, you probably won’t sell anything significant on social media, as the attention is mediocre. However, you can get a lot out of social media ads and interactions if you focus on raising awareness and nudging potential customers into your funnel.
