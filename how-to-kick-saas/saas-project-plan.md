# SaaS Project Plan

Your Project Manager will build a [project plan](https://www.teamgantt.com/guide-to-project-management/how-to-plan-a-project) before you start. This is often confused with an information architecture by clients, but is a completely different document. A SaaS project plan is a general set of timelines, tasks, responsibilities, deadlines, and expectations for all team members and stakeholders. The project manager will meet with everyone to discuss this project plan and get everyoneâ€™s consensus on it before getting started.
