# Strengths are also weaknesses

As you can imagine, someone who cannot deal with things being out of place, late, or disorganized and is inflexible about this is also hard to deal with. The best PM’s I’ve met have some heightened level of neuroticism, but have learned to overcome the social issues that come with it and become strategic, charismatic, and masterful managers of people. However, this isn’t most people or most PMs. So remember when you’re thinking about your PM that you want someone who prioritizes getting things done above being nice all the time. That is often the tradeoff you deal with, and that’s fine because you want the thing done on time and under budget.
