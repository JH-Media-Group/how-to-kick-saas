# SaaS Development Project Management

If you are an entrepreneur starting a SaaS business, a C-level executive getting the SaaS built for your company, or a developer, designer, or project manager building a tool system, the first and one of the best things you can do for yourself is to take a course on Project Management. If you’re going to do this, **YOU MUST HAVE MORE THAN A RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF AGILE DEVELOPMENT**.

**PROTIP**

If you do nothing else, take an hour or two and read the [Atlassian guide to project management](https://www.atlassian.com/project-management). It will be worth it’s time in dollars tenfold, guaranteed. If you don’t have an understanding of project management before going into this process, you are setting yourself up for failure.
