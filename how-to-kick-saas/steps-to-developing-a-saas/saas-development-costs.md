# Saas Development Costs

“How much does it cost to build a SaaS?” I get asked this a lot. It’s like being asked “how much does it cost to build a building?” The answer is, it depends. 

* [ ] Are you building a shed, a house, a factory, or a skyscraper?
* [ ] Is it in the middle of New York City or out in the countryside of Chiang Mai?
* [ ] How much does labor cost in that area?
* [ ] How much do materials cost? 

As you can see, it’s a big question.

Fortunately, I did an entire video and long blog article to answer this question!
