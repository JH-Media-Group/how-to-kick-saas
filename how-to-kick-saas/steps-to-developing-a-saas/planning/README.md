# Planning

**This step will save or lose you the most money of anything in the project, so don’t rush it.** 

Developers want to develop, designers want to design, project managers want to manage, and entrepreneurs want cash flow. But for the most part, very few people are really interested in planning all this stuff out in super fine detail. 

If you’re reading this, you probably fall into one of those categories as well, so listen up, plan like it is your job; plan like your bank account and/or life depends on it \(because it does\). Plan everything -- as much as possible -- and know you are going to change what you are planning and some of that time is going to be wasted, and that is fine.  

Below are the general steps to be completed, AFTER you have completed your competition analysis and validation.

### Write a SaaS architecture document

This is the process of writing down every page, every feature, every sub feature, etc. and how they work together. Learning to architect SaaS systems is by itself a full-time job, so plan on getting someone to help you if you don’t know how to do it already. 

Just like an architect for a building, you need to understand every aspect of what is going into that building to know the best ways to build it. If you don’t have experience in this and you’re a SaaS entrepreneur, just hire someone to help you. 

But before you start, you still need to write it all down. My recommendation for this is to read the [BrainLeaf book on how to scope projects](https://www.brainleaf.com/learn-project-scoping). It is built for agency owners, but applies very directly to SaaS as well. This text will explain how to write out all the pieces of your system.

#### Determine which technologies you’re going to be using

A lot of time developers start working with the technologies they are familiar with to build something, only to realize later that it wasn’t the right choice and that they have to rebuild the system from scratch or make major changes. Also, technologies change all the time in the cloud, so whatever you choose needs to be something you are going to be happy spending a long time working with.
