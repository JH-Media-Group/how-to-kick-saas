# Organic Search Marketing

Organic search marketing for a SaaS means that people search the internet for a need they have and your solution is shown. This is one of the most valuable aspects of marketing for most SaaS businesses because you can rank at the top of the search engines for the need your target market has and you don’t have to pay advertising costs to be there.  


Make no mistake, you will end up paying to rank due to the time it takes to get your content produced and distributed online. But if you pay the money to rank organically, very often the cost of maintaining a top ranked position is substantially less than paying for advertising. Additionally, when you rank at the top for one keyword, you are very often ranking at the top of search engines for multiple other keywords as well.  


It takes time to rank, so start early

This section is placed at the top of the growth methods for two reasons. First, it is one of the most effective and second, it takes the longest, and so it needs to be started early. Even if you do all of your keyword research, planning, and writing up front and all your shiny new articles are live on day one, it will take several months to rank.  


There is often the question “Why does it take so long to rank?” Ever heard of the [Google Sandbox](https://www.brainleaf.com/blog/seo/what-is-the-google-sandbox-and-what-does-it-mean/)? Basically, when you launch a new website, Google and most of the other search engines don’t trust you. The search engine doesn’t know the difference between you and a scam or other predatory website. Just like any relationship, it takes time to build trust. In this case it takes somewhere between 3 and 6 months. But the easier you make it for search engines to search your site, the more likely they are to trust you sonner, so follow those technical SEO best practices and you’ll have a shorter wait.     


Impatient? I get it, but I’m telling you it’s worth the wait.  


Storytime: My team had a big push for content on a brand new business at the beginning of this year. We did our research and planning and then we wrote about a dozen articles of around 1,000-1,200 words a piece and posted them onto our blog all at once. Then we waited; well, actually, we worked our butts off on all the other marketing tasks on the list, but as far as content was concerned, we just kind of let it marinate.  


Six months later we started getting a ton of phone calls and we realized our contact form had been blowing up, in both a good and a bad way. A lot of people had been filling it out, but it wasn’t notifying us \(that’s an unfortunate side story -- so test your contact form regularly because the last thing you want is to do all this work to get customers, and then ignore them\).  


Why was everyone suddenly reaching out to us in the middle of the summer? That’s when we ranked number one. [Here’s one of our articles that ranks particularly well](http://jhmediagroup.com/blog/2017/11/13/improve-diagnostic-imaging-marketing/). We are now the top search result for at least five of the keywords we were targeting. Surprise, surprise -- people are finding us now! The real point of the story is that we put a bunch of energy into content marketing before we did any other marketing. Because of that, we went from zero to number one in a matter of six months and had a ton of people wanting to buy our thing. And we never spent a dime on ads.  


Google’s magic mojo takes time, so don’t expect results right away. If you go through the steps in this chapter you will rank. But no matter how great your articles are, it won’t happen overnight.  


Content marketing is an investment for your SaaS business

Yes, it’s going to take a good chunk of time or money to get through your baseline content, but it’s really going to end up saving you a lot of money in the long run.  


Comparing content marketing to paid ads is like comparing buying an oven and a refrigerator to going for take-out. Getting your kitchen to the point that you’re able to store food and cook is going to cost a lot more than a to-go box of kung pao chicken, but once your appliances are up and running, you’re going to be saving money long-term.  


Paid ads are like ordering take-out. It’s relatively easy, it’s fast, and it keeps you from getting hangry. It’s a nice add on to the typical grocery store to refrigerator to oven method of keeping your belly full, but it’s not reasonable to rely on take-out alone unless you have a ton of money and aren’t too concerned about a healthy diet.  


Content marketing, search marketing, SEO, organic ranking -- whatever you want to call it -- is not only a worthwhile investment, it’s a necessary one.  
  


If you skip this you’re almost definitely going to fail

It’s a hard truth, but you don’t have much choice. I have met a lot of successful and not-so-successful SaaS business owners over the years and, with the exception of a few enterprise level systems, I have never met anyone who has been successful who has skipped or half-assed this step. Take the time to do this right and it will be so worth it. Remember, this is how your customers are going to be able to find out that the thing you’re building even exists.  


Search marketing is an entire industry, and this single book cannot teach you all that you need to know to effectively continue to rank at the top all the time. So instead, this book will show you the basic things you NEED to know, a few tricks that work very well for SaaS systems, and give you places to grow your knowledge.  
  


#### Step 1: Keyword Research

Keyword research is the process of figuring out what keywords you should, can, and cannot rank for. This process also gives you a method for ranking for those keywords.  


If there was one single growth item that I would recommend, it is to do your keyword research before you ever write a single article. I made this mistake, I know tons of people who’ve made this mistake, and every time they realize the depth of the mistake, every one of them regrets it \(including me\). The total initial research time on this process is about a day, but the lost time from not doing it is weeks, months, or potentially more! So take the time on this one.  


Project goal: Find a list of keywords that your users are searching for and know how hard or easy it is to rank for each one.  


Follow-up goal: Create a list of articles that could be written that will rank you for those keywords.  


Search Volume and Google

The first step to keyword research is learning what keywords people are searching for, aka search volume. You may think you’ve got that all figured out already, but even if you have some great ideas, you don’t know until you know. This is about variations in language as well as related topics of interest. If we just went for the keyword “scope of work” without doing our research, we wouldn’t have realized until stumbling upon it down the road that people are also searching for “statement of work”.  


To find your search volume I recommend using [Google’s keyword planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/). If you’re already spending money on PPC ads this will be easily accessible. If not, you can still use the tool, but you’ll get a range instead of an exact number. A lot of other keyword tools provide search volume too, but Google is the most reliable. There’s going to be a bunch of other info that Google gives you beyond search volume, I recommend you set that aside for later since it mostly relates to PPC.  


Negative keywords: Eliminating what you don’t want

In Google’s keyword planner, enter your best guesses of what people would search for and you’ll get about 1,500 suggestions. Some of those might be way off base. For example, I was looking for keyword ideas related to improving doctor reviews. Google suggested several dozen terms related to headphone reviews, which seemed completely unrelated. Then I realized the connection they made: Doctors =&gt; Dr. Dre =&gt; Beats by Dre =&gt; Headphone reviews. Once I realized what was going on it didn’t seem so silly. Afterall, he is probably one of the most popular doctors around.  


Here’s where negative keywords come into play. As entertaining as Dr. Dre and his headphone reviews may be, they were cluttering up my keyword list. So I eliminated “Dre” and “headphones” by adding those as negative keywords on my search.  


If you’re running PPC ads, negative keywords will need to be revisited in that arena separately where they are even more important. For SEO you could always pick those negative keywords out one by one \(though you wouldn’t want to\). But for PPC you pay for each click an off target search produces, so don’t forget your negative keywords on PPC!  


Filters

Exactly whose search you care about will depend on your specific SaaS endeavor. Is it only people in the US? Is it only searches in the past six months? By now you know who you’re looking for and adding filters will give you a better picture of searches that actually matter to your cause.  


Pruning your list

Don’t bother reading every suggestion just yet. Once you have a decent list from Google, export it and go through them one by one deleting any that are too far off base. Ask yourself, who would be searching for each term. In my keyword research targeting terms doctors or hospitals would be searching for I realized that hundreds of suggested keywords would actually be things patients would search for. “How to leave a Yelp review for a doctor” is pretty clearly a patient’s search, but some of them required a little more thought. In any case you don’t need all 1,000+ keywords that Google listed, so weed them out.  


During this process and all of your future keyword research steps you will likely think of things to add to the list, which is a good thing. You might even want to go back to Google and get more suggestions, which is also a good thing. Even if your list is gigantic, don’t be afraid to add more. As you go through your suggestions you’ll get ideas and the terms you add yourself are often the most targeted and valuable.  


Note: CRTL+F is your friend here and throughout your keyword research spreadsheet journey.  


Keyword difficulty

Once you have your list looking nice and relevant, you can move on to the next step which is difficulty. This is the most important data point for your keywords because it tells you whether a term is worth pursuing or you’re wasting your time. Keyword difficulty reflects how much effort you’ll need to put into that keyword to rank for it. Difficulty is scored between 0 and 100 with low scores being less difficult. If a keyword has a lot of people or really powerful sites vying for it, the difficulty will be higher.  


![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/03TS2wlxXuYkQ2DoZLCvIlUr6NcRzPK5BI9gqoaKnwP3w3v4e2hMf1Ece3RfvFn-1tA3h99h64BRyuj4ZKabY_pd_cxz7uQSnWJq9M3IP12zNefwqBIyF3apns6SaSIyVmoDZmrC)

There are several systems that you can use to find your keyword difficulty. I recommend [Moz.com](https://moz.com/explorer). It’s easy to use and has a ton of data that is very reliable. You can run a few searches each day for free, or you can set up an account, which will be necessary in order to provide depth to your research \(and is free for 30 days\). That way you can run a list \(or several\) and just drop your data into your spreadsheet. Once you get your data in one sheet, match up your volume and difficulty using a “Vlookup” spreadsheet formula.  


Assessing your most valuable keywords

Now that you have all the data together you’ll have to turn on your brain to assess what keywords are actually best for you. If you’re just getting started with SEO then you want to go after the lowest difficulty keywords first. Ideally, that means keywords with difficulty of less than 20. If that’s just not an option for you then you can choose keywords that are in the low 20s and just work your ass off to rank for them.  


Pick out your favorite low difficulty keywords and highlight them so they don’t get lost in the mix.  


PROTIP: Sort out your difficulty, volume, and other factors by using conditional formatting in your spreadsheet to color code specific ranges of values.  


Keyword groups

Once you have picked over your keywords you probably still have a few hundred remaining. Now it’s time to sort them. How you group your keywords will depend on your business.  


Take this example. You launched a SaaS that helps people register for local dance classes. Your keyword groups might be something like this:  


* Latin dances
* Ballroom dances
* Tap dance
* Line dance

Or something like this:  


* Intro classes
* Series classes
* Kids classes
* Private lessons

Or a mixture of the two, or something else entirely, like location based terms. It really depends on what’s on your list. Basically, if you have a bunch of keywords related to a topic, make a new tab for it and copy/paste those babies over.  


Domain authority

For those of you who are new to the keyword game, we need to discuss domain authority since yours is probably low. Domain authority is the strength of your domain. Higher is better and you can generally expect your domain authority to increase over time if you’re putting a decent amount of effort into your keyword strategy.  


Domain authority is basically brownie points that a site has earned with search engines, so their content is ranked higher than the same content would be on a site with low domain authority. You can check your domain authority on Moz or a number of other systems if you’re not sure where you stand.  


![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oe3rF32PdXD513vbGwoFRVKQVrvQxKF4LY8_-h0JWFyk5fFRsep93rU-G8_Cwl64OmjYmuyZ57_oo_ZB2zVBjdIiLxTZ39PlVn3IPzTSfygEwo_uQg_-6eCeWZ9kJGSQ9kdNmHvm)

As a general rule, it’s a waste of time to try and rank for any keywords with a difficulty above 20 if your domain authority is below 20. If you want to compete on keywords with a higher difficulty, you need to boost your domain authority up first.  


Long-tail keywords: Your ticket to the top

Alright, I know you just dumped a ton of stuff into your spreadsheet and then deleted most of it. But we are going to need to add more, and no matter how confident you are in what you’ve got so far, don’t skip this part.  


Long-tail keywords are more specific keyword phrases or complete thoughts. These are also often the kinds of requests that people ask verbally to Alexa, Google, and Siri \(do people still talk to Siri?\) They tend to have lower search volume, or may not even register on Google’s Keyword Planner. But don’t be deceived! Long-tail keywords account for 70% of all searches and they are far more targeted than short-tail keywords. On top of that, 15-20% of all searches have never been searched before, so new isn’t always bad.  


Let’s stick with the dance class registration system from our previous example. You’re working on your SEO and Google’s Keyword Planner gives you tons of suggestions with high search volume like:  


* Dance classes
* Dance lessons
* Summer dance classes
* Sign up for dance classes
* Dance classes near me

These seem targeted, after all, the dance class thing is your thing. Then you go to Moz and find out that most of those have a fairly difficult rating. Bummer. Don’t worry, you didn’t want those any way.  


You want long-tail keywords. That means specific phrases that people are searching when they really know what they want and they are ready to take action. We’re talking things like:  


* Where can I take a 6 week waltz class in Nashville?
* How much is a beginner’s hip hop class for teens?
* Where can my fiance and I take private dance lessons before our wedding?

These are the kind of things people are searching when they know what they want and they are looking for a specific solution. Those are the people who are ready to convert.  


So how do you know what long-tail keywords to go for? First, go after phrases are the most specific to the thing that you do. Then see what the top rankers for that phrase are. That’s your SERP analysis.  
  


SERP analysis

SERP stands for Search Engine Results Page. Your SERP analysis is an assessment of the current top ranking results for a specific keyword search. Moz gives you some data on this, but really this one is going to take a bit of manual investigation.  


Let’s say you are trying to choose which of the long-tail keywords from the above example to try for. Start by plugging those into the Moz Keyword Explorer. That will show you the top ranking sites for the term and their domain authority. If the domain authority is high then search engines care less about their content.  


![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/37HdA3Oa4Onl_ZQUDCdN4zzjXVT6K-hUMuO39jFznlX6KQbsEq7H-2EKRhTP4BBiVO_5amhNLKRh_8D9apZQ7ogsELXWU1jNIs9bKmeH5T4MjBZzLsQp2oyhV3BWGCnTulJc7rx8)

Next, look at each of the top pages. Is the content, specific, lengthy, and well written? If the answer is not really then you might stand a chance. Often times I see pages ranking for keywords that aren’t even on the page. Google works in mysterious ways.  


How you rate your SERP is up to you. I usually assign a score ranging from one to five.  
  


What to do with that glorious spreadsheet

Once you have all of these steps complete you should have a clear picture of what keywords are best for your business with a handful that really stand out. Maybe some these are the ones you had in mind before you started this process, maybe not. Either way the keyword research was worth it.  


There are two main ways to use your keywords, and you should use both.  


First you can sprinkle them around your homepage and other pages on your main site. These will likely be some of those short-tail keywords. What’s that look like?  


In my example, my tagline on my homepage might have been:

“The easy way to find and register for dance classes in one place”  


Let’s imagine that from my keyword research I found that the keyword “Register for dance classes” had a difficulty of 52 which is just not going to work. But I also found that “sign up for dance classes online” had a difficulty of 33 \(still hard but better than 52\). So I change my tagline to:  


“The easy way to find and sign up for dance classes online”  


Easy right? Now do that for all of the content on your site.  


The second way to use your keywords is on your blog, which is more involved. So you need to start with a plan.  
  


#### Step 2: Content Planning

Throughout this entire process you’ve \(hopefully\) been getting ideas for some killer articles to write for your blog.  


Hold up -- what if you already have a bunch of articles you worked your hiney off on before you realized keywords were a thing?  


If that’s you, then take the time here to go back over those articles and sprinkle keywords in where they make sense. This should be a process similar to the way you sprinkled keywords into your site content. If they are not in your keyword spreadsheet, make sure you check the difficulty on the terms you’re currently using in your articles before you replace them with your new favorites. You don’t want to accidently replace something that was helping your rank.  


If you’re starting from scratch or you finished sprucing up your old articles then it’s time to make a new spreadsheet to plan your content. That spreadsheet will have one article per row and columns for the title, keywords, links and other items.  


Let’s talk strategy

There are a bunch of content strategies out there, but two main ideas:  


First you can write a bunch of small articles, around 1,500 words each. This is a good strategy for businesses that have a variety of keyword topics, multiple customer personas, or you just don’t have the time to write all your content at once. This is a good strategy for most people just starting out.  


The Skyscraper Method

The other option is to use the Skyscraper Method. For this one you write one mammoth article of 10,000 words or more. This method is great for SaaS businesses that have the time to do a bunch of research up front and are focused on a single topic or idea. If after doing your keyword research you came to the conclusion that there was one clear article idea that was massively powerful like Jafar from Aladdin while all the others were basically just the sidekick parrot Iago without the annoying voice then this method is a good way to go.  


If you’re going this route, you’re going to be on a journey that lies outside the guidance for this book, but I will leave you with some tips to send you on your way.  


1. Plan a backlink campaign. This method will set you up to generate great backlinks thus boosting your ranking.
2. Write smaller supporting articles and link them all to the main article.
3. Promote your main article all over the place.
4. Research the skyscraper SEO strategy. [This article is a good place to start.](https://blog.monitorbacklinks.com/seo/skyscraper-technique-seo/)

If this is your mission, I do still recommend you read the next section as it will help you formulate a content plan, though it still needs to be tailored.  


Before we get started, a visual might be nice. Here’s an example of a real life content plan.  


![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fZ3aRf_QwN4gin6JJV7DDu4uFA0V6vbyaevssRGVfxbNAxpyGPyJzqFqAUlvrG4EP99Vy1kSQnaCFcgB1H_UU7GcLQI5skBFVMOo4QGqrCmnx6ebEXKwszlfJQvGcBea7H20CXSv)

Adding keywords to your plan

You might think titles come first, but..nope. Go back to your handy dandy keyword groups and pick out 3 keywords per article idea. They should all be high value \(meaning low difficulty\) and directly related to the main idea of the article.  


Make sure you put these in order of priority, with the keyword of the highest value or that is most directly related to the article topic first and the second and third keywords supporting that topic even if the wording is different.  


For our example I might plan an article with these keywords:  


1. Wedding dance lessons
2. Private dance lessons for couples
3. Compare wedding dance lessons

Article titles

Turning your ideas into titles might be simple, but that doesn’t mean it’s always easy. The reason this wasn’t the first step is you will need to include your main keyword in your title. Not only does your title need to contain your main keyword, it needs to be catchy.  


For ideas on titles, run a Google search to see what other people are using for their titles. Here are a few that I saw:  


1. Wedding Dance Lessons Atlanta, GA – Private Couples Lessons
2. Atlanta Dance Lessons & Wedding Dance Instruction - mywedding.com
3. The 5 Best Wedding Dance Lessons Near Me \(with Free Estimates\)

Looks like most everyone is going with location specific content, yet upon further inspection most of those guys have written about a paragraph.  


My title is going to be either  


1. How To Find Wedding Dance Lessons For A First Dance You’ll Never Forget
2. An Insider’s Guide to Choosing the Best Wedding Dance Lessons

The first one is good because the keyword is closer to the beginning, but it’s a little long, so it will probably be cut off. The second one is good because it’s catchy, but I might change “An Insider’s” to something else.  


Remember, keywords get your article seen on search results, but your title is the thing that earns the clicks. So don’t be afraid to mull it over.  


LSI keywords

This is the part of the infomercial where Billy Mays says “But wait there’s more!” As soon as your brain turns to mashed potatoes it’s time to find your LSI keywords. Those are Latent Search Index keywords and you’ve seen them before. They hang out at the bottom of the first page of a google search as “Searches related to…”  


Now that you have your three main keywords for your article you should pick out 2 or three LSI keywords to go along with them. There are a few systems you can use to grab these. I like [LSI Graph](https://lsigraph.com) \(which is not a graph at all\). Plug in your article’s main keyword and choose a few LSI keywords from the list to sprinkle into your writing. Add those to your content spreadsheet and of course check the difficulty if you’re torn between a few.  


Resources

I add resources into my content plan, not because I am going to link to them, but for my writer \(sometimes that’s me\) to reference. Each article is going to require some research and resources will help you flesh out your outline and points to hit. I always add in the current site ranking at the top for my main keyword so I know what I need to beat. I also add any articles that my competitors wrote that were done well so I don’t miss any major talking points.  


Links

Any good article should have links of two types, optimized and non-optimized. You should strive for a 50/50 balance as much as possible.  


Optimized links are links in which the anchor text \(aka. The text that you’re linking to a URL\) is the same or very close to one of your keywords.  


Here’s an example snippet from my pretend article:  


Your first dance as a married couple is one of the most memorable moments that you’ll share not only with your new spouse, but with friends and family. It can be tough to decide, but if you compare wedding dance lessons nearby, you can be sure you’re choosing the right instructor for your budget and schedule as well as your dance style.  


What would I link that to? Probably a page on my site that lets people compare dance lessons. If that’s not a thing, I could link this text to an third party article that explains how to compare wedding dance lessons. If your link leads to a third-party article you should make sure it’s not written by a competitor.  


Non-optimized links are those that use anchor text that is not one of your keywords. That could be anything from “learn more in this article” to “take the dance style quiz.” Like optimized links it’s awesome if you can link to another article or page on your site \(internal link\), but if not, linking to a third party source \(external link\) will do just fine. There is no secret ratio for internal vs external links, but try and have a good mix.  


PROTIP: The most important factor in linking is that the page you’re linking to is clearly and directly related to it’s anchor text and that everything is relevant to your overall article topic.  


Weighing importance: Cornerstone content

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c9ewgRY-vJq8eGAjBOIudu3Ufay43wKanWq6M6vGV3Q65K36BixdLlR3m0DMaVoEVikJNULY2C_zp24NahHtV7T1F0X0VKMwoRP75qCZnW2ktet1Wgxsts0RfLvD5g_ICAwHK9AZ)

Some articles are going to be more important to your cause than others and that’s the way it should be. Your overall content plan should resemble a pyramid with the home page at the top, cornerstone content just below that, major articles below that, and long-tail keyword content at the bottom. Even if you don’t formally introduce the pyramid into your strategy, you should determine what articles will be your cornerstone content \(ie. your most in depth articles on your most essential topics.\)  


Your internal link structure should follow this pyramid patterns as well with links from the bottom upward and from the top downward.  


Putting it all together

Once you have your articles planned out you’ll need to determine the order of the postings. Does one article build on the previous? Is there a topic you visit twice, but in different ways? Are there a few articles you know inside out and could get done with tomorrow? These are some of the things that will help you determine the best order to write and post your content in.  


You’ll also want to think about your schedule. Are you able to make a commitment to post one article a week? One a month? Or are you planning to write 10 articles before you launch and put them all up at once and take it from there? The point here is to figure out what you’re going to realistically be able to do and commit to it. You can always change your schedule later, but it kills your opportunity to build a returning reader base if you post 3 articles a month and then take a 6 month hiatus.  
  


#### Step 3: Writing, Formatting, and Beyond

As with many SaaS marketing strategies, there was a lot of work to get to this point where the rubber meets the road. So, jump in the car, I hope you like road trips.  


One of the biggest mistakes I see businesses make with their content is that they look at all those articles they want to write and then hire someone overseas for $4.75 an hour to blaze through them. Sure you might get your 1,500 word article done for $20, but if the content isn’t worth reading, guess what: no one is going to read it. All that work to get top rankings and hard earned clicks, just to have a bounce rate through the roof is not going to get you the business you’re looking for.  


If you don’t have time to write the articles yourself, you’re in the same boat as just about everyone else starting a business. Don’t get me wrong, you can certainly hire a writer, but even the best writer will need training to understand your goals, your branding, your ideas, and how to utilize your content plan.  


If you think you’ve found one guy or gal that can take care of everything content related from this point forward, either you’re mistaken, you’re spending a fortune, or you’ve found a unicorn who is also a genie. There’s more than just writing to be done, there’s research, outlining and  editing. Then there’s formatting, designing, and testing \(not to mention analytics!\).  


If you have a front-end developer and designer on your team, they will come in handy for the latter part. Otherwise a contractor or anyone on your team with HTML experience should get you by just fine.  


It’s so much!  


It’s not that much. Let’s go through it.  


Outlining and research

Don’t skip it. It didn’t work out well on that college term paper and it won’t work out well here. Check out your competitors and other articles that go over similar topics and brainstorm those along with all those juicy ideas floating around in your brain.  


If my competition had an article about the “3 most popular dance styles in Chicago” I might not necessarily be writing about the “4 most popular dance styles in Chicago.” Or maybe I would be writing that article, but the point is that I would touch on those 3 dance styles and their popularity amongst Chicagoans if I am trying to beat out that article.  


When you’re outlining your article you should know that your formatting is going to matter in just a little while. What that means to you now is that the major sections of your article need to be about the three keywords you picked out earlier with an honorable mention for each of your LSI keywords.  


Keyword placement & article structure

If you’re new to the game, or even if you’re not, I recommend starting out with some templates. You can find [free SEO templates online](https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates). If you’re more experienced you may consider writing your own template based on successful past articles.  


Whether you’re using a template or not, you ‘ll want your three keywords to be in corresponding headers as well as the body of the paragraph\(s\) beneath the header. So keyword 1 should be in your first &lt;h1&gt; tag and in the paragraph following it. Continue in that fashion with all 3 keywords.  


Here are a few tips on keyword placement and article structure:  


1. The text beneath each header can contain additional headers, but make sure they are smaller than the three headers with your keywords if they are nested.
2. Add your main keyword to several places throughout the article.
3. Add your links to paragraphs that are focused on their specific topics.
4. Keep your paragraphs short.
5. Include formatting like bold text, italics, lists, etc where it naturally fits.
6. Include an introduction and a summary, both of which contain your main keyword.
7. Add a CTA after the introduction and after the summary.
8. Highlight each keyword and link so you can find them easily later.

Reel them in with CTAs

CTAs \(aka. Calls to Action\) are how you’re going to get people from your blog to your homepage, or whatever other page you need them to go to to take the next step toward becoming a customer.  


Some SaaS businesses use CTAs that really stand out from the article while others make them blend with the rest of the text to look less salesy. Only you, or A/B testing, know what CTA style is best for your business. A common CTA might be something like this:

The right way to write

When you’re writing your articles the number one thing that makes people stick around to actually read it, or share it on social media, or remember you for more than 23 seconds after they leave your site is how much actionable information your article gives them to help them solve the problem they are searching for a solution to.  


Don’t throw up words on the screen just to get to a certain word count. In fact, don’t even look at the word count at all. It doesn’t matter if you write a million words. If it’s all fluff no one is going to read it.  


You are in charge of an entire SaaS system that is built around the topics you’re writing about.On top of that you have been doing research, on each and every article you write. You have a ton of knowledge and that’s what people want. So don’t hold back information.  


A lot of business owners don’t want to share their secrets, information they have collected, or lessons they learned the hard way for fear that their competition will get ahold of it and one-up them. Well, with the exception of stuff that should actually stay private, don’t hold back valuable information. The internet is big and mighty and people can and will find what they want if they look hard enough. They might as well find it easily with your article and bookmark it, or better yet, link to it.  


Formatting to your CMS

Once you have your article written and edited you’ll be ready to put it up on your CMS. I’ve made the mistake of copying and pasting the whole thing in and expecting the formatting to come along with it. Unless you have some kind of magical Wordpress plugin that you should definitely tell me about immediately, the result is not great. It just won’t work like that.  


Whether you’re using a visual editor or HTML, please make sure to check out how it’s looking as you go. You don’t want to work for a half hour on this just to have to redo it.  


Images

Blogs are just more fun with pictures. Not only do pictures make your articles more interesting and pretty, they help your SEO and decrease your bounce rate.  


But you can’t just grab any old image you’d like off the internet and put it up on your post. That’s stealing and it’s not allowed. Consider paying for something like Adobe Stock or Envato so you can get a ton of great pics. Or try a free image provider like Pixabay.  


Here are a few of my tips for adding images to a blog post:  


1. Always rename your images and add Alt text. The description and Alt text should be in line with your keywords.
2. Make sure you resize your photos before uploading them to your blog or else they might affect your loading.
3. Have a designer create your featured images.

Metadata

The metadata or meta description is the preview text that Google shows below the article title in the search results. This should be attention grabbing, easy to read, and unique. Avoid all caps, incomplete sentences, or a ton of exclamation points.  


Use your main keyword in your description if you can and keep it around 160 characters. I like to throw in an attention grabbing statistic when I can.  


Here’s an example meta description:  


76% of couples never learn to move to music together. Find and compare pre wedding dance lessons so you can have a dance to remember long after your wedding day.  
  


Pop Ups

You see them all over the place, and I get it, they can be annoying. But I’m telling you, they work and they are the best way to coax readers over to your site or lure them onto your email list by offering valuable downloadable content.  


I use Sumo for my pop ups because it’s easy to use and versatile. There are all kinds of styles and I can’t tell you what works best for your audience. I have gotten a high click rate with a sticky top bar style as well as a slide in sidebar style, while other SaaS owners I know have found that the full screen doormat style converts best.  


PROTIP: A/B testing is crucial to find the sweet spot. Test your style, timing, imagery, wording, landing page, and anything else you can modify.  
  
  


There’s more -- there’s always more

This is the acceptance stage. There will always be more to learn. Once you get your process solidified, the internet will change and you’ll have to learn new stuff. There are big companies out there that do nothing but SEO and content marketing. And even they don’t know it all. Fortunately you now know more than most folks getting started and you can always read up on more specifics to beef up your rank faster.
