# Acquisition: Getting SaaS Users

When you’re first starting a SaaS, if you don’t have an audience initially, you are probably wondering where all these paying customers are going to come from. Right away, you probably did some simple math and realized that if you just had 200 or 300 users you’d be doing fine.  


Well, if you are solving a problem worth solving \(validation\) and pricing the system at prices where your different groups of users are willing to pay \(appraisement\) and you can make money, then it’s just a matter of informing people why your system is available and better than the competition or whatever system they are already using.  


Simple, right?  


Actually, it is. Like anything, if you know what to do, it’s easy.
