# SaaS flows, processes, and planning

Now that you see why you absolutely need to have a UX designer on your SaaS development team, let’s talk about their process so you know if the person you’re hiring actually knows what their doing. Not everyone’s process is the same, but they should be at least similar to this.

Your SaaS UX Designer Should:

1. **Ask you a lot of questions about your users.**
2. **Ask you a lot of questions about what elements are more or less important** \(priority\) on each page.
3. Take the time to **thoroughly understand system users, what the system does, what the system provides users, and why users will use the system**.
4. **Ensure you have a well thought out information architecture.**
5. **Create a list of flows for your system.** These are usually simple wireframes that show the steps a user will take to get through different processes in the system.
6. **Get the feedback of everyone on the team** as to how users will flow through the system.
7. **Be very upset if everyone on the development team doesn’t look over what they’re putting together**, and so should you.
8. Once they have consensus from the team, **build out basic or more than basic designs for each page and view** that show the main interaction aspects of each page, view, and feature \(like the ones shown in the case study\).
9. A senior level SaaS UX designer almost always has design skills as well and will often be able to **put together the design for most of the pages and views in the system**. But if not, you may also need an additional web or graphic designer to do some of the more intricate designs. Just makes sure that your front-end developer reviews any work a graphic designer does before it is approved to be included in the system. Graphic designers are notorious for designing things that can’t be coded!
10. Your SaaS UX designer should also **help you write the content for the pages they are working on**. UX is all about explaining how things work, and if they can’t write up the text that explains what a user should be doing or how they should be using a tool of feature in the system, you should strongly consider getting a different UX designer. Don’t think for a second that it is a simple job to write up all the on-page instructions. It is very time-consuming, and the best person to do that work is the person designing the flow the users are going to take or should be taking.
11. While the designs are being implemented, the UX designer should **review the process flows.** Even the best planned designs get changed, and you are GOING to change their work as the developers get into it. So they need to plan on being in meetings with developers as they are building the tool so UX design considerations can be taken into account.
