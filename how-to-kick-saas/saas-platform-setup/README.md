# SaaS Platform Setup

You did it! You got past the design phase. Now not only are you super excited about this thing you’re building, but you also have a bunch of designs to start selling to people or presenting to all the people you already pre-sold your system to! Happy day!

Now it’s time to put those developers to work and get the logic, functionality, and integrations built.
