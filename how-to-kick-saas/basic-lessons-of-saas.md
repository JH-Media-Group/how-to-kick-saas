# Basic Lessons of Saas

### Lesson 1: When you’re building a SaaS, you’re building a business. 

Most people I’ve talked to over the years about SaaS think a lot about the product and then what they’re going to be doing with their millions of dollars, but the work between those points is vital to reaching those goals. The first thing people don’t realize is that when you’re building a SaaS, you’re building a business just like any other. 

This is how most people think about SaaS.

Some basic things you’re going to need in your new business include upfront and ongoing costs  such as:

1. A federal tax ID - In the US, where I am, this is the first step in starting a new business. 
2. Website hosting - It’s got to live somewhere, right? 
3. A phone number\(s\) - Don’t think you can get away forever without one of these, ‘cause you can’t. 
4. Customer service agents - A lot of people are going to be asking a lot of questions, and if you’re out traveling the world or collecting your millions, how are you going to answer them? 
5. Customer service software - Got to keep all those requests straight. 
6. Electricity - In one way or another you’re going to end up paying for this. 
7. Insurance - You may not need this at first, but I guarantee you will eventually. 
8. Security Systems - Those pesky hackers all want your money and information. Better to pre-empt them than pay a ransom \(which happens everyday\). 
9. An advertising budget - Your Google overlords don’t work for free you know. 
10. Marketing - The people of the world aren’t going to find you without you being in front of them, saying the right things, and lookin pretty! 
11. Marketing software - so you can keep all those marketing dollars working. 
12. Customer Relationship Management \(CRM\) software - A way to track and manage all those nice people giving you money every month. 
13. Sales team members - someone has to answer those customer questions before they give you their money! 
14. Money management software - now that you have things to pay for, you’re going to need a way to manage where all your money is going. 
15. Taxes - How are you going to buy coffee for those long nights if you don’t have things like roads? 

If that sounds like a lot of stuff, that’s because it is. Starting a business is time consuming, has  an element of risk, and costs a lot. This is the mistake so many people make. They think they’re  building software when in fact they are building a business. 

However, if all this stuff sounds like it’s right up your alley, then let’s keep going! 

If not, you may want to consider putting the computer down for a few minutes and taking a little walk to rethink this project; if you aren’t excited about working on all the things mentioned above, you’re probably just going to be throwing your money away and getting frustrated. Also, you’ve probably heard the saying that ‘as a new entrepreneur you get to choose your own hours, and that means you can work any 16 hours per day you want’. If this doesn’t sound like your idea of a good time or you don’t have the means to do this \(at least for a while\)… well, just think about it ok?

###   n’t apply

But most of the time it does, or at least some variation of this applies. So don’t skimp on it, go through it, take the time, and know your business, or you are going to end up throwing away your time and money.

An example of how this may not apply is if you’re already in the market and fulfilling requested needs of existing customers, or have some inside knowledge about the market. While these situations may mitigate the need to go through this whole process, you will still almost definitely want to go through some aspects of it.
