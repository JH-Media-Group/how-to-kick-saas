# SaaS Traction, Marketing, Sales & Growth

## **Appraisement, Acquisition, & Attrition**

If you didn’t skip straight to this part of the book, now you have enough to understand what you’re building and basically how the whole build process is going to go. Now we’re ready to talk about how to price your system, get people using it, and keep them! If you recall from the beginning of the book, these are the 3 A’s of SaaS:  


* Appraisement: Setting the price.
* Acquisition: Getting paying users.
* Attrition & Retainment: Keeping users on your system.

Obviously, different types of SaaS businesses have different methods of gaining traction and will be able to gain more or less from the process below. However, all SaaS systems will use aspects of these items in one way or another.
