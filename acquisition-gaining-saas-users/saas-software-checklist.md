        <p>LuckyOrange</p>
        <p>http://www.luckyorange.com</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">The system allows you to see your users&#x2019; mouse movements in real
        time, record movements, setup funnels, and run tons of reports.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">Very similar to LuckyOrange. Better looking and easier to use, also has
        a few features that LuckyOrange doesn&#x2019;t. But can get substantially

        the content on your site based on the different user types that may be
        coming to the site. This helps increase the conversion rate across the

      <td style="text-align:left">Moz was the original SEO tool. It still has some of the best metrics for
        certain areas, and a variety of tools in areas that neither SEMrush or
        ahrefs has, but it is more focused on agencies these days in my opinion.</td>

        keeps adding great new tools to the system. The only thing to point out
        about this tool is that it is NOT development project management tool.

### Final note on SaaS systems for SaaS systems

There are a million systems out there that do pretty much anything you can think of. The list I gave you here are the ones that I’ve used or had some interaction with. If you’ve got great new ones, let me know and I can add it to the list. But only send over time-tested systems, this is a personally curated list and I don’t want it to turn into producthunt.com.
