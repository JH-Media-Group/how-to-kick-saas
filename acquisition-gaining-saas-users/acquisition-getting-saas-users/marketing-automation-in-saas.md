# Marketing Automation in SaaS

Like search engine marketing, marketing automation is a huge subject and something that other texts can educate you more thoroughly on. This book aims to give you the basics, some tips and tricks, and get you started rather than fully deliver every aspect of this industry.  


Because of the scalability of SaaS businesses, if you don’t have a way to automatically reach out, engage, educate, and communicate with your audience across channels regularly, it won’t get done. Which means you will lose out to other businesses who can and do.  


Marketing automation is absolutely necessary for almost all SaaS businesses, and the more your business can utilize marketing automation, the more you can grow. At first, it may seem like a simple set of tasks to create a few messages that go out to your people somewhat regularly, but when you start exploring the depths of what can and should be done, you realize the rabbit holes goes deep and may not have an end.

#### What can be done with marketing automation in SaaS?

Where you start:

When you’re just getting going, you basically know who your users are and what they want. So you send them a set of welcome emails and then follow up with them every other week to tell them about how the product is progressing and what new tools have been added.

Initial conversion rate: 3% - 5%

Where you can go:

1. A new user sees a blog article or post on social media that they think they randomly stumbled upon \(they didn’t\).
2. The messaging happens to meet their needs perfectly and the system features are exactly what they are looking for \(because it was tailored specifically to their demographic\).
3. They click on the link and on the home page see someone exactly in their role accomplishing the goal they want to accomplish \(because each user type has a different view that they now see\).
4. The messaging on the page is exactly what they need to hear to get a trial started \(because you formed it specifically for them\), so they sign up.
5. The onboarding process hits their specific needs and focuses on their issues and the parts of the system they need \(because you knew who they were and what issues they would have before they ever started\).
6. After they sign up, the user receives a set of onboarding emails that match their role and and needs and explains how to integrate the system into their business \(because you know exactly what this process is and how it works\).
7. After getting into the system, a customer representative calls them to check in and seems to completely understand their business needs with a set of questions and answers that they clearly know fits the user.
8. Your potential customer decides that this company clearly understands their needs and solves their problems, so they are going to pay for the system.
9. After they start paying, they get ongoing educational information about their role and their industry with graphics that match exactly who they are \(crazy huh?\).
10. All of this is just the beginning.

Want to guess on the conversion rates on this kind of user specified setup?

New conversion rate: Would you believe 23%?!  


This is a REAL CASE STUDY. It actually happened. This business went from 3% - 5% up to an incredible 23% conversion rate.  


That’s a pretty solid increase. But there have been companies that brought their conversion rates as high as 50%. Now that is crazy. If you’re still wondering about the power of marketing automation, knowing your customers, connecting with them in ways they respond to, and solving their problems how they need them solved, now you know.  


#### What is and is not marketing automation in SaaS?

Now that I’ve sold you on needing marketing automation, let’s talk about what exactly it is and is not.  


1. Most people, when they first hear about it, think it is email marketing or a fancy way to spam people. It’s not.
2. People also think that it’s a ‘set it and forget it’ system. It’s not that either.
3. Finally, some people, once seeing what this kind of platform can do sometimes think of it as a magic bullet. It’s definitely not that.

Marketing automation includes the following features or areas:  


* Campaign Management
* Email Marketing
* Landing Pages
* Lead Scoring
* Lead Management
* CRM Systems Integration
* Social Media Marketing
* Analytics

Just like everything else we’ve discussed in this book, marketing automation for SaaS systems is iterative. You have to constantly hypothesize, test, and retest to get to maximum efficiency, and no system is going to do that for you. Until the computers take over, it’s people that have to do this, and it is time consuming!  
  


#### Marketing automation basics for SaaS

Outside of explaining what Marketing Automation is for SaaS and why you need it, this chapter covers the things most SaaS businesses absolutely must have. The things that get you started and enable you to start analyzing data, iterating, and growing.

#### The Customer Journey

A customer goes from awareness to advocacy in the steps listed below. As we start looking at ways to give SaaS customers the right information, we need to start by understanding where they are along this path.  


![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7cUpQW1lqsUGKValk4d8NZhxXcJUNxWBQbPMwXdNsoUB8je2vZkaFlnjGqIXhukNLk3LjoKTI22kEdGFkw_eva_mPLDgamqFAeUYyZmjMJ1U5yBhy3HH_EJlbn8oFpMQv_uGGO-a)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ts_bFp2QVh5XfxO17DVSALEej8hAJa3PosNGlZUjjJsPMyVvxwASnvnNZ2cgfI-NTQnXO2hJTRizERQJ4rpjNjiGe9z1SUrN_LD264IRJ-ReNcEFqqAG6ccsS6K17UbfjfPyCFK6)

1. Unawareness
   1. Do they know they have a problem?
   2. If not, why not? This is a critical question for you!
2. Awareness
   1. They know they have a problem and are starting to look for solutions.
3. Consideration
   1. The potential customer finds your solution among many possible solutions.
   2. They educate themselves, review, read reviews and more.
4. Purchase
   1. They are ready to make a purchase and decide to do so.
5. Retention
   1. Now they’re in your system and you have their ear. How are you staying relevant?
6. Advocacy
   1. You did a great job and nurturing this customer. Now they have become an advocate for your product!
   2. They become your most powerful sales tool and spread the word of your greatness!

In order to know what to send to someone, you need to understand where they are in this journey as well as who they are as noted in [the chapter on Appraisement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLCH0YaNhxbutZeK9Oo87n9PhssDaHLkWLTPYW0UIMQ/edit#heading=h.y5okxgh434nx). Once you know those things, then you can build the right messaging for your soon-to-be raving fans and loyal customers.  


Let’s play a quick mental game to see why this is important.

Let’s say someone comes to your website and gives you their email address to get the e-book on how to scope a SaaS project. You then send them a series of educational emails showing them how your system helps them scope SaaS projects. As they get these emails there are triggers in each one that help you decide who these people are. Depending on what they click on, you mark them as interested in one feature set over another, and slowing move them into one of your customer personas.  


Further down the journey, you have an avid customer that uses your system daily. Now you are sending them tips and tricks on how to use advanced features, templates you know apply to their needs, phone calls asking them how they would like to see the product improved, and an invite to the conference your company is putting on. All the while, the design of the emails they are getting and landing pages they get to are designed specifically for their persona, so they connect perfectly with it. They’re probably going to stay a loyal customer.  


Now, flip the communications. That doesn’t make sense, does it? Clearly, you need to know who is who and what their interests are in order to send them the right things.  


Storytime: Learning about product awareness the hard way

“Have you looked up the customer buying cycle? Maybe people don’t realize they have the problem you’re solving.” Pete told me as we were sitting on a bench in the Letna beer garden overlooking Prague.  


The garden has a single Pilsner Urquell stand with all the varieties of Pilsner Urquell and a little restaurant where you can get bratwursts. It fits snugly between the gardens in the trees and the edge of a high high hill overlooking the city center. From our picnic table, I could see the city and the castle off on the right in the distance.  


I sipped my beer and looked out over the city trying to figure out if all this time and money had been wasted.  


“Yeah,” I said. “Maybe you’re right.”  


I was in town for a digital entrepreneurs conference and Pete was in one of my mastermind groups. During the conference I learned about how Pete used to be a front-end developer who loved CrossFit and how he managed to move from being a services provider to running an fair-sized products company with a big following. He was now positioned as one of the world’s top sellers of Crossfit jump ropes. Having just started down the path of going from a digital marketer and developer to a SaaS founder, I was blown away by his stories.  


Sometime during the day I had asked the group about the SaaS I was working on at the time, BrainLeaf, and how to grow my sales. The group had immediately delved into the product, the problem, and much more. I got a lot of answers and a lot of ideas that day. After the conference was done for the day, a group of us all went out for drinks at the beer garden. Pete and I were the only two left as the night was falling and the temperature started to drop.  


“Can you expand on the customer buying cycle for me?” I asked as my skin started to bristle with the cool breeze.  


“Yeah, of course.” He responded, “Unawareness is that the person doesn’t know they have the problem. Awareness means they are aware of the issue, but may or may not be looking for a solution yet. If the problem is bad, then they might be looking. If not, then at least they know it’s a problem. Consideration means they are actively researching the issue and are looking for a solution. Purchase means, well, they’re making a purchase. Just like purchase, the next two steps, retention and advocacy, are pretty straight forward.”  


“I guess I just never really thought about it” I said.  


“From what you’re telling me, the problem is that the people you’re marketing to don’t know that they have a problem. It sounds like you need to either do a better job of marketing to the right people or form some kind of awareness building system.” he replied, looking at me, then looking down at his phone.  


“I think that is exactly the problem,” I said. “People who have the problem that my system solves are either experienced and already have a solution or they just entered the market, don’t realize they have an issue, get burned badly because they didn’t realize they had the issue and failed a project because of it, then leave the market. So that makes my pool of potential buyers a lot smaller than I had initially thought.” I said.  


“Well, maybe there are groups of people that are looking for a solution to this? Maybe check Facebook for private groups that are testing out solutions for this.” Pete said looking down at his phone again. I could tell that he was checking the time and, despite having half a beer remaining, probably needed to get going.  


“You could also maybe start a podcast or something that talks about how to solve this problem and create an audience around the issue. What I think you need is an audience before the product on this one.” he said looking at me this time.  


“You’re right” I said, “I wish I had talked to you about this probably three years ago.”  


“Don’t worry man. We all go through this. It happens to everyone, just keep on plugging away and you’ll get it. I went through the same kinds of things myself over and over till I got it figured out. Let’s talk again tomorrow at the conference about this, I have to get going to get back to my room for a call with the factory in China in about fifteen minutes.” he said before downing the other half of his beer and standing up. “I’ll see you tomorrow!”  


“Thanks Pete, that was super helpful. I’ll see you in the morning!” I replied, standing up to shake his hand.  


I turned back towards the city after saying goodbye and noticed that even more lights had come on and the sun set further. Prague was beautiful that night, but I was left trying to figure out if how I was going to deal with this awareness issue.  


It had me looking forward to the next day at the conference.  


#### Lead Scoring, Tagging, & Triggers

I highly recommend reading [this Medium article by Myk Pono on Lead Scoring](https://medium.com/@myxys/how-to-design-lead-nurturing-lead-scoring-and-drip-email-campaigns-9961024f6605) as well as a great book on this, [The Definitive Guide to Lead Scoring by Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/definitive-guides/lead-scoring/). These texts will give you a deep dive into this area. In this chapter, I will try to distill both of those into a more simplified set of principles and actions for you.  


![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Dyd8RHamdkLdOk5MOGo35wQZdxbadOa_enwc0QpWrg4C45VMbjtl0L_8j-Ulz-s7yFDS2q4Al7CGOL8C7oXuY1HkyJIcdDekwUfUK5HRnAUxsFNU0rgsVFiMCldf3LM15aKnmyHo)

What is Lead Scoring?

Lead scoring helps you identify who you need to be talking to and what information they need to receive in an automated fashion.  


Lead scoring doesn’t specifically relate to emails, but in a lot of SaaS businesses, automated emails are a big part of the system. In many SaaS businesses, you have the following customer contact campaigns that should be in place.

SaaS Customer Contact Campaigns:

First the email campaigns. They are the easiest to create:  


* Welcome campaign
* Onboarding campaign
* Nurture campaign
* Product engagement campaign
* Upsell campaign
* Renewal campaigns

In addition to email campaigns though, you also have things like:  


* Chatbot messages for different user types, flows, etc.
* Different kinds of phone calls to be made to users
* Direct mail
* Actually visiting your customers \(this really happens\)

Lead scoring is going to help you figure out who needs to get which campaign and when in an automated fashion.  


Before we can know what to send, we need to understand a few main indicators as well as the flow of the user lifecycle for a SaaS, then break them apart and put numbers to them:  


* What part of the buying process your user is in \(described in previous section\).
* If the problem they have is what your SaaS solves
* If their actions show them to be a valuable lead
* Who they are or their customer persona, if that can be determined.

Flow:

1. Visitor - someone that visited your website
2. Prospect  - a user that downloaded a lead magnet
3. Activated User - a user that signed up for your system
4. Customer - a user that has paid for your system
5. Active Customer - a customer that paid for your system and is using your system
6. Loyal Customer -  a customer who paid for your system and is increasing their use of the system.

#### SaaS Email Campaigns

Rather than building a complex formula, I like to think about this system in action or task focused process. In creating this system, we want to answer the question “at what point do I need to send what to who?” So let’s assign values and correlate those values to actions.  


How sure am I that I am talking to the right person for my product? First we need to know who they are. So let’s assign some simple values to what we know about them. Different SaaS businesses are different, but here is how we monitor people at BrainLeaf. These methods were built up over time and review of analytics.  


Visitor gets sent:

* Educational information about their problem
* Asked to sign up for the system or for more information so we can better qualify them.

Prospect gets sent:

* Product information
* Case studies
* Demos of the system
* Sales presentation

Activated User

* User onboarding
* Tips and best practices
* Offers for help
* Regular Newsletter
* Product updates
* Educational content
* Requests to become a paying customer
* Unfinished flows

Customer

* All items from activated user except for requests to become a paying customer
* Customer onboarding

Active Customer

* All items from activated user except for requests to become a paying customer
* Upsell campaign
* Notify user of usage limits
* Feature benefits
* New Releases
* Promotions
* Renewal campaign

Loyal Customer

* All items from activated user except for requests to become a paying customer
* Partnership campaign
* Personal relationship/word of mouth building campaigns

In addition to email campaigns there are a lot of other ways to reach out to your potential customers. These can be methods such as:

* Chatbot messages when the user views your marketing site or accesses your SaaS
* Social media messages or posts
* Direct mail
* An actual phone call
* A follow-up phone call.

{% hint style="info" %}
**PROTIP:** When you’re first planning your SaaS business, make sure to plan plenty of time to work on all of these emails. For each email, you’re going to need design, copywriting, and some amount of development. It always takes longer than you expect to do these. Also, don’t think that you’re going to be done after you finish up the first version of these, you’re absolutely going to iterate on these as soon as they start going out.
{% endhint %}

When it comes down to it, for the most part the emails that users are going to get fall into the lists of items noted above. There may be some variation, but it usually goes this way. However, how do you know where to escalate the user to the point where your sales team takes over?

#### Lead Scoring

Lead scoring is based on two main things. The first is how much does the system solve their problems and how much does the user fit the profile to which you’re selling.

Scoring Attributes

The more we know about the user, the more we can determine where they fall in our list. The first things we can almost always get is their profile information. This includes the following fields:

* Name
* Email
* Role
* Company Size
* Business Type

For each of these items we can assign a score, the higher the better. In the points example below, the name and email are not taken into consideration in points, but we have to have these to process the user, so we require them. Depending on what your SaaS business does, you will need more or less information, but this is a good start.  


Next, we need to know if what the user is actually interested in what your system does or if they are just passing through. These kinds of actions are totally dependent on the system you’re building.  


Depending on your drip email and marketing automation system, you may have either simple or customizable lead scoring systems. If you can customize your lead scoring, my recommendation is to escalate to your sales teams based on a score you set up in the system.  


Below are some examples of how we initially set up our points system for BrainLeaf. It has since been changed, but it’s a good place to explore.

Example Points System:

Remember, we are not looking for Freelancers. Our target personas are noted in the personas section in the appraisement section.  


* They got here by:
  * 10 points:
    * Referral from an ad
  * 5 points:
    * Our top blog article on how to scope a project, then they read the article for more than 5 minutes.
  * 1 point:
    * Everything else
* Who are they? When a user signs up we usually know:
  * Their business name: no points assigned. However, we look at everyone that comes in and if the business is very large we will sometimes escalate that visitor directly to the sales team.
  * Their type of business:
    * 1 point: Freelancer - we like to know if someone is a freelancer or not
    * 5 points: Marketing - digital or traditional
    * 10 points: Development
    * Enterprise - business is escalated
  * The size of their business - with the use of a 3rd party system
    * 1 point: 1 person
    * 5 points: 2 - 10 people
    * 10 points: 11 - 25 people
    * 15 points: 25 - 100 people
    * More than 100: these groups get automatically sent to our sales team for follow-up every time
  * Their position within the business \(CEO is marked in the middle because they are often freelancers and not really in our target market\)
    * 1 point: Freelancer
    * 2 points: Founder
    * 2 points: CEO - this is often a freelancer, so it is scored lower.
    * 5 points: Project Manager
    * 5 points: Marketing Manager
    * 10 points: CMO
    * 15 points: CTO
* Is their use of the system indicating that they need the system?
  * Did they start a new project?
    * 5 points: yes
  * More than one new project?
    * 5 points: yes
  * Did they use a template?
    * 5 points: small business template
    * 10 points: complex/development template
  * Did they add their teammates?
    * 1 point per teammate
  * Did they send a contract out to a customer?
    * 10 points: yes

When we take a look at the totals, we can see the system groups itself.

Scenario 1

| Action | Points | Running Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Got here from the blog | 5 | 5 |
| Business Type: Freelancer | 1 | 6 |
| Size of business: 1 | 1 | 7 |
| Position: Founder | 3 | 10 |
| Action: Started a new project | 5 | 15 |
| Action: Small business template | 5 | 20 |
| Total |  | 20 |

Scenario 2

| Action | Points | Running Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Came in from ad | 10 | 10 |
| Business Type: Marketing | 5 | 15 |
| Size of business: 7 | 5 | 20 |
| Position: Project Manager | 3 | 23 |
| Action: Started a new project | 5 | 28 |
| Action: Small business template | 5 | 33 |
| Action: Added 3 team members | 3 | 36 |
| Action: Sent contract to user | 10 | 46 |
| Total |  | 46 |

Scenario 3

| Action | Points | Running Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Came in from blog article | 5 | 5 |
| Business Type: Development | 10 | 15 |
| Size of business: 33 | 15 | 30 |
| Position: Project Manager | 3 | 33 |
| Action: Started a new project | 5 | 38 |
| Action: Complex template | 10 | 48 |
| Action: Sent contract to user | 10 | 58 |
| Total |  | 58 |

Analysis:

As you can see from these different scenarios, the groups we want get pushed up fast. Sales team members can work through top people first, then get to the lower level leads. If someone ranks very high, we can set up some custom notifications that they need to be contacted.  


Scenario 1 is definitely a freelancer and should be lower down the list to be contacted. Whereas scenario 3 is a mid-sized development company and should be contacted as soon as possible with a phone call. All we need to do is take a look at our leads list for the day or week, sort them by score start working those leads.  


The trick here is not to overcomplicate things. Just add the top indicators and actions, at least in the beginning. As time goes by and you have more data, add more indicators or play around with other triggers, but make it simple to start.

Putting together Lead Scoring, SaaS email campaigns and sales:

In our scenarios, you can see that there is a pretty big jump between the first user, the Freelancer, and the second two groups. This jump makes it easy for sales team members to work the list. It also makes it easy to create other automations. For example, you could set an automatic action in your CRM for any user that comes in with a score over 60 to call or send a personal email.  


You could also set up automated emails to users that rank at a 30 or below that help them understand why they need the system as lower level users often fall into the first couple sections of the buying cycle.  


PROTIP: Lead scoring took me a long time to get figure out. It wasn’t that important when we first got started, but when we started to grow it became important fast. People need to know what to do first, what’s most important, and what their processes are for different scenarios. If you set up a good lead scoring system it can make a big difference in how well and fast you process users and make sales.

#### Marketing Automation Systems

At the time of writing, recommended systems used to set up these automated emails, manage lists, manage the automations and triggers, etc. are:  


* Drip.com
* Convertkit.com
* Activecampaign.com
* Marketo.com

These days, there are hundreds of great systems out there for this kind of thing, so pick your poison. I like Drip.com a lot right now, but my team is constantly working with new systems. It’s probably that I don’t like spend money if I don’t have to. What’s working well for us now is a mixture of Drip.com as the email automation system, paired with Pipedrive and a set of zaps from Zapier. We integrate all these systems into Slack so the team can see what’s going on all the time.  


A couple common systems that I would NOT recommend for new SaaS are:  


* Infusionsoft.com - Can be very, very effective. But if you are just getting started, it is often too expensive.
* Mailchimp.com - This system is too simple for the kinds of marketing automation that you need in SaaS systems. Don’t get me wrong, I like Mailchimp and I used to be literally one floor above them in my old office, but outside of using Mandrill, a MailChimp service, for transactional emails, Mailchimp is a bit too simple for what you’ll need for a SaaS system.
