# Marketing Automation Systems

## Marketing Automation Systems

At the time of writing, recommended systems used to set up these automated emails, manage lists, manage the automations and triggers, etc. are:

* [Drip.com](www.Drip.com)
* [Convertkit.com](www.Convertkit.com)
* [Activecampaign.com](www.Activecampaign.com)
* [Marketo.com](www.Marketo.com)

These days, there are hundreds of great systems out there for this kind of thing, so pick your poison. I like Drip.com a lot right now, but my team is constantly working with new systems. It’s probably that I don’t like spend money if I don’t have to. What’s working well for us now is a mixture of Drip.com as the email automation system, paired with Pipedrive and a set of zaps from Zapier. We integrate all these systems into Slack so the team can see what’s going on all the time.

### A common systems that I would NOT recommend for new SaaS are:

* [Infusionsoft.com](www.Infusionsoft.com) - Can be very, very effective. But if you are just getting started, it is often too expensive.
* [Mailchimp.com](www.mailchimp.com) - This system is too simple for the kinds of marketing automation that you need in SaaS systems. Don’t get me wrong, I like Mailchimp and I used to be literally one floor above them in my old office, but outside of using Mandrill, a MailChimp service, for transactional emails, Mailchimp is a bit too simple for what you’ll need for a SaaS system.
