# Marketing-Based Sales SaaS

### How could this have been avoided?

David had gone through several of the aspects of the validation process, but he didn't reach out to his target market and talk to them first. It's that simple. If David had asked a few questions he would have realized that this wasn't going to work the way he expected. 

There are several ways this could have been accomplished. 

#### 1. Go to the tradeshow as an attendee and just ask people if they would buy the system. 

So many people I have spoken to when I recommend something like this say "I can't afford to spend 2k on a tradeshow where I'm not going to make any money!"

My answer is simple. Would you rather spend 2k figuring out if this will work or 100k building something you'll never make a dollar from? 

#### 2. Send a survey

If you don't know your audience, you probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. So, get started with taking a list of people in the industry and asking them all to take a quick survey. You'll want to have some aspects of what you're building ready to view before you do this, but even if you don't you can still ask questions. 

Even if you are entering a new market that you don't know that much about, you could take the following methods to find the people to ask:

1. Join an association and get their members list
2. Do market research and hire a VA \(virtual assistant\) to find email addresses
3. Run some ads on Facebook targeted towards your users and ask them to fill out your survey. You can also offer to compensate them. Just make sure to set up only a limit to the number of people you're going to pay. 

Here are some of the questions that David may have used for his target audience:

1. How do you currently collect local wage and benefits information from the largest local employers?
   1. We don't collect or distribute this data
   2. We have a consultant do this for us
   3. We use state-wide data
   4. We have an in-house person do this for us
2. How often do you collect this data?
   1. More than once a year
   2. Once a year
   3. Every other year
   4. Every three years
   5. Whenever we have time, but more than every 3 years
3. What is the cost of collecting this data?
   1. Free
   2. 1k - 5k
   3. 5k - 10k
   4. 10k - 20k
   5. 20k - 30k
   6. 30k+
4. What are your top frustrations with collecting this information?
   1. Text answer
5. For groups using consultants or in-house staff, what is your process for getting this data?
6. If there was a software system that just required you to send out a pre-built survey and make some followup calls to your industries, would you use it?
7. How much would you pay for this system?
   1. I wouldn't pay for it
   2. Less than 1k per year
   3. 1k - 2.5k per year
   4. 2.5k - 5k per year
   5. 5k - 10k per year
   6. 10k+ per year
8. What system features would you find most valuable? \(put in order of importance\) 
   1. The form would auto-fill last years' answers for industries \(link to video showing how this would work\)
   2. The system would anonymously collect all data and auto-compile it for you.
   3. Integrate with HRI systems to import industry compensation data automatically.
   4. Advanced web-based dashboard specifically built to help industries understand this data.
9. Would you buy this software if I built it?
   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. Maybe \(if maybe, why?\)
10. If yes: if I were to give you 50% off for the first year, knowing the system would be done a year from now, would you be willing to pay for the system now?
    1. Yes
    2. No
11. If yes, would you be willing to do a phone call with me to talk more about this?
    1. Yes - links to calendar scheduling system
    2. No
