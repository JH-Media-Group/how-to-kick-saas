# The SaaS Validation Process

## SECTION IN PROCESS... 

## What is Validation

### Do you gamble? 

Without validation, you are walking into a smoky casino, putting your money on the table, and spinning the roulette wheel. Most business owners don’t want to take big gambles with their money though. After all, even if you win this round, you’re going to go bust eventually. Instead of what comes down to guessing, this chapter is going to show you how to guarantee you’re going to make money before making a big investment.

Validation is not just important, it’s critical if you’re going to be successful. When people are critical of this process, I like to remind them that they can either go through this process at the start, before they have invested tons of money and time, or go through it after they have invested time and money and that money has gone to waste. One way or another, you’re going to face the validation process. Choosing to do it upfront and ensuring you have the right offering for the right group at the right price at is delivered in the right way before you start will rocket you ahead, rather than rebuilding, reworking, and wasting money later.

Skipping this single step is the thing that drives most SaaS businesses out of business, and usually after a big investment of time and money. As you read through this chapter, if you realize you already skipped this step and your business isn’t growing, I would strongly recommend taking a step back, reading this chapter, and doing all the exercises. At the very least, it will help you organize your thoughts and validate that what you’re doing is correct. But if your foundation isn’t solid, this chapter will shine a light on the flaws and could potentially save you a huge amount of time and money. 

### Validating a SaaS

Validating a SaaS is very similar to validating other kinds of businesses, except with a SaaS you automatically know some specific information about how the business will work, how it will be delivered, how you will probably be pricing your services, what methods you will probably be using to market your services, and how your customer will find you \(it’s probably going to be on the internet\). 

Knowing that your business is internet-based is a great start, but you still have to go through ensuring that whatever you create or buy is still going to sell at a price where you make money and can grow towards your goals. So in these ways, it’s a hair more straightforward that some other businesses. But the process is essentially the same. There are many books that have been written on validating a business, one of my favorites being “The Lean Startup” by Eric Reis. I highly recommend you read this book before starting this or any other business.

### Validation is Research

Sometimes it’s called ‘market research’ or ‘market fit research’ or a variety of other things, but at the end of the day, it is a lot of phone calls, list-making, emails, meetings, surveys, asking questions, changing plans, and sometimes frustration. 

As an entrepreneur or product owner working on a new system, you probably want to move and move fast. This is the downfall of so many SaaS businesses. Without doing your validation step, you’re going to end up with a lot of waste. So as you progress through this step, consider this the first step in your business or business unit growth. 

These questions and their answers are critical to the success of a new business or a new offering. By the time you finish this section, you will have a good idea of what you're doing and why, who you're selling to, who's already selling to that group and how they're doing it, how much money you're going to make and what it's going to take to get this to market, and most importantly if you still want to do this. 

We will cover the following aspects of SaaS validation:

* Why & What
* The problem, Need, Solution
* Buyers
* Competitors
* Distribution
* Revenue & Costs
* Time & Investment
* The secret sauce
* Going to Market

## Why are you doing this?

In my experience, there are only a handful of reasons why someone builds a new SaaS product. These are:

1. I am building a tool that I want for myself or need for my company
2. It’s a good idea and people need it.
3. I want to make money
4. I have access to knowledge that others do not and I can make money selling it
5. I already have a system built or someone is paying me to build a system that I will own rights to use or own completely and think people will buy it.
6. There is a similar system on the market and I think I can do it cheaper or better or there is room for competition.
7. I have a market already that needs this tool and can sell it as soon as it is done.
8. I was hired to build it.

All of these reasons are good, but some require more research than others. If you have access to knowledge or information that other people are seeking and can sell it to a market you know, then you’re in a great position. But if you’re building a tool that you need for yourself, then there is a good chance that A\) someone has already done this and B\) someone has done this better already. Neither of these reasons take you out of the market, but it poses certain complications for you. 

Let’s start our validation journey with understanding why you’re thinking about investing a substantial amount of time and money and your chances of success for each scenario. 

### I need this system for myself or my company

So often I speak to new SaaS entrepreneurs that say that they built their product because they needed it at their company and couldn't find anything else that did the job in the way they needed it done. The catch here is that if you're building a product for your company, which is built around your processes. This means that you are not often building a broad tool, you are building a specific tool around a specific set of processes. The odds that everyone else is going to adopt your process is not good, even if your way is actually better. 

Additionally, building a specific tool means you are not building a broad tool. This can sometimes work in your favor if you are building a very specific tool, not a platform, that does just one main thing. But often if a company is building a tool for themselves it is to manage their processes, not just to fulfill one function. 

The next issue you will encounter is that if you are building a process management tool that is specific to your process you will often end up competing against tools that are very broad and robust, such as Excel or Slack. If those are your competitors, then you need to have a very specific niche and an overwhelming reason why buyers need your project not those projects. 

I am not suggesting that you can’t get traction with a niche tool, people do it all the time. But you need to do a substantial amount of competitor research before going any further.

### It's a good idea and people need it.

Uber is a good idea, and people needed it. In fact, it was a great idea and people all over the world needed it badly.  Having a great idea that solves a problem that people need to be solved is great. If you're going into an industry or an area that you're not familiar with, you're going to have to learn an entirely new career. So you're going to make a lot of mistakes and it's going to take a long time. 

If you already have experience in the industry, you know the idea is good, and you know people need the system, then all you have to do is query them to make sure you're correct and they're willing to pay the amount you need them to pay to support the system. 

### I want to make money

If your only reason for doing this is to make money, and you are a leader in the business, then I would recommend no doing this and investing in more tested businesses. There is nothing wrong with wanting to make money at all, and it’s a completely legitimate reason for going into business. But this path is going to be hard and it’s probably going to take a long time to make money. So my recommendation is to invest in real estate or the stock market. 

### I have access to knowledge that others do not and I can make money selling it.

Since you’re selling knowledge, your SaaS falls into the “filling a knowledge gap” SaaS and is usually something that may take a  substantial effort to take from your mind into the system. Since you have special knowledge, you probably also know people in the industry and or have some influence on the market.  

### I already have a system built or someone is paying me to build a system that I will own the rights to use or own completely and think people will buy it.

This happens A LOT with developers and development teams. This has happened to me a number of times. Here’s the deal with this, you must go through the process of validation and especially the process of fully understanding your costs. Very often a SaaS will have ongoing operational costs as well as hard costs, that can wrack up fast. You’ll have developers, integrations that change regularly that you have to keep up with, compliance to laws, insurance, the cost of support, legal fees, and much more. Even if you have the system built, you need to remember that you have costs that you will incur on a monthly basis just to keep things moving, so you’re going to need sales. So you still need to do a full validation process. 

### There is a similar system on the market and I think I can do it cheaper or better or there is room for competition.

This is one of my favorite reasons. If there is already a competitor and it is is not a monster business like Google or Facebook, you know the market, and you know that the current system has major failings that could be done better, then you have a unique selling proposition, a market that you can approach that probably already has issues with the current system, and you know they are buying it. You have everything you need to get started validating your business!

### I have a market already that needs this tool and can sell it as soon as it is done.

If you have a market, built the market, and understand what goes into selling to this market, then you are already well on your way to success. In so many SaaS businesses what people are missing is an audience, not a tool. People build tools thinking that people will come, when the reality is that you often build an audience, then the tool will sell. This is a great reason to build or buy a tool to sell to your audience. 

### I want to start a business

This is probably the worst reason on the list to build a SaaS business. If you have money to blow and your primary reason for doing this is that you want to start a business, my advice is to invest in real estate. It is a lot more secure, has a substantially higher chance of returning a profit, and is one of the most secure investments you can make. Building and running a successful SaaS takes a tremendous amount of time and money, and very often a good bit of luck. If you just like businesses and think this could be fun, my question is “Why don’t you start a shipping company?” Probably because you don’t know much about shipping and the barrier to entry seems pretty high. If you’re not already in this industry or the industry you’re selling to, the same things apply. 

### I have some money put away and I thought this might be a good place to put it to use.

I added this item for all those investors out there that are wondering if they should invest in a SaaS or if they are considering taking over an investment they’ve already made. The same thing applies here as above. Not to be redundant, but remember that the number one indicator of success in a SaaS business is the number of times the person starting the system has done it in the past. 

If the system is already in place and you’re stepping in to manage the business side of things, make sure you have a competent CTO already in place. If you don’t and aren’t familiar with the systems, technology, or acumen used in this industry and you think it’s going to be the same as running any other business, to some extent you’re right, but my experience is that you have a lower chance of success in this kind of venture than more traditional ventures. 

### I was hired to build it

Good for you! I am so impressed that you are reading this book! I wish so much I had taken the time when I started to be more forward thinking and read books like this. If you’ve been hired to build a SaaS or PaaS my highest recommendation is that you ensure that your client has gone through a thorough validation process. Without taking your client through the validation process thoroughly, you are going to get blamed for the failure of the product. If you’re being paid to do this, then skipping this step is almost certainly going to lead you down a path that you will regret. 

If you’ve already started on the system, that’s fine. Tell your client that you think this is a good next step. If you’re pretty far along already, then taking this step now rather than later will help save on any future losses. It will also help your client understand what they need to do next.

The truth about validation is that you’re going to do it one way or another. It’s now or later, but either way your validation will come in the way of upfront planning, mid-build pain, or go to market failure. Either way, it will come to you, so do the right thing and make sure it happens sooner than later.

## Should you do this?

There are a few questions that immediately tell me if someone should or should not start a new SaaS business. The way these questions are answered can tell me within a couple of minutes if the business unit manager or entrepreneur understands:

* What they’re embarking on
* If they’re doing it for the right reasons
* If they know the market
* What challenges they will face
* How much time and money it will take 
* If they understand the problem, their proposed solution, and the need for this solution
* The competition, what they’re doing, who they are selling to, and how much they cost
* Why people will buy from them instead of their competitors
* The different buyer personas, what features they value, and how much they will pay
* How they are going to distribute the product
* If they have any unfair advantages

If they understand or have good ideas about at least two thirds of these, then they probably have a good idea about where to go with the rest of it and are on the right track. If not, my recommendation is to take a hard look at your plans. 

Below is a list of what I look for in each of these statements, the followup questions I ask, and my recommendations.

### What are your goals?

Goals are measurable, so a good way to think about your goals is in a two step process. Think about the ‘measurement’, what success looks like in the way of revenue, number of employees, personal income, and the impact you’re making as well as the way you’re making that impact. The think about the picture of this business in more qualitative terms. How would you feel about the business if it were as successful as you want? What would your day to day job look like? How would you treat the people you work with? How would they treat you?

Some of the aspects of these goals you may want to consider include the ways you:

* Change the world
* Make things better
* Fix a problem
* Make money
* Have a particular lifestyle
* Or maybe just afford a flight \(my reason for starting a few different businesses\)

Start off with your measurements. Here are some metrics to consider:

1. How much money do you foresee your business making each year? You can back into this solution by calculating the number of potential customers, the amount they will pay each month, then the amount of the total market size you can reasonably take. 
2. How much time do you want to spend working on this business in one year, three years, and 5 years?
3. How much money do you want to make each month?
4. How many people do you expect to be required to maintain this business?
5. How long do you expect it will take to gain market share and why?

Next, the ‘picture’ of the business should be explained in more qualitative terms, although quantitative measurements are fine as well. I am a very analytical person, so almost all of my goals are qualitative and I usually have just one or two quantitative measurements. The goal here is to paint a picture of what this business will look like in the associated time frames so that you know where you’re going and can set goals that will actually get you there. 

### Can you fill in the blanks in the following sentence: “My SaaS or PaaS solves \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ problem for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ audience or audiences?”

It has to be that simple, and starting out with this problem, solution, and audience is the best way to start because you can easily test to be sure your target audiences actually need the solution you’re providing. 

Your system must solve a clear problem for a group of people that can be defined as an audience or set of audiences. You’ve probably heard of the “elevator pitch.” This is how you explain to someone what you do in the time you’re on an elevator. I don’t know about you, but in the elevator at my last office it had to be more of a seven second pitch, and I got pretty good at it. 

After maybe the 20th time I saw someone on the elevator, they would usually start asking things like “so what do you do,” or “what does your company do?” It wasn’t an overnight thing because we lots of things. It took a while before I could say “We help startups and mid-market companies build software as a service businesses and offerings.” Sounds so simple, right? As you probably know if you’ve ever tried to do this for a business that hadn’t previously had a strong focus, it isn’t. 

But if you have the chance from the very beginning to set your targets and test them, then you don’t have to squander years like I did trying to figure out what you actually want to do.

So solve it up front. After all, what are you going to tell everyone on the elevator when they ask? 

### What is the problem, solution, and need? 

So often you have a problem and a solution, but what about the need? To sell a product, you must have all three. What very often happens is that the entrepreneur sees the problem and can contemplate a great solution, but if they don’t take the time to identify the need, they build a product that will never sell because people don’t need it badly enough to pay for it. It happens fairly frequently that a system is built, but that no one was asked if and how much they would pay for the system. It turns out that the user base is already using a system like Excel or Word to do the job, which they are already paying for, and they don’t have a strong enough need to move to the new system. So the SaaS fails because the need just isn’t there. 

The way to overcome this is multifold. Start off by Querying your users up front, before you have started developing a system. Make sure you show potential users what you are building as you build it and ask them what they would need to make a purchase. 

If users are already using a system such as excel, word, or other normal business tools to solve the problem, identify where those tools fail AND what aspects of those tools you will need to reproduce. ‘Normal’ business tools such as Google Sheets, Microsoft Word, and Salesforce are extremely robust systems, and many people take for granted the power of these tools. If your users are leveraging aspects of these kinds of tools in their day to day process and your system is just one addition or solution that will take them away from those tools, the user will have extra time they will need to come away from their normal tools to work with yours. So you must ensure it is A\) worth their extra time and B\) worth their extra money.  

These and other steps are a part of the full validation process outlined later in this chapter. 

### How well do you know this market? 

If you’ve read this far, you probably already know where this is going. If you don’t know the market, then to get into it, you’re going to need to learn all about it. That doesn’t mean just learning your one part of the market, it means learning the entire market, including things like:

* Market lingo
* How the market works
* Players in the market
* How different players in the market interact
* How sales are done and what is and is not important in those sales
* How your target market operates as well as how their competitors, vendors, partners, etc. operate.
* The processes involved in delivering the product or service
* What constitutes a good or bad product or service in this industry
* Contacts at different levels and areas in the industry
* So much more

When you enter a new market, you are committing to learning a new career. Let’s say you’re currently a developer, designer, or accountant. How long did it take for you to get good at your job? Probably a long time, because almost nothing worth doing is easy. If it was simple to become a millionaire, or just to make a livable wage in many places, I guarantee more people would be doing it. 

So why do you think you can enter a new market you’ve never worked in and suddenly be successful? The fact is, you probably won’t. So stick to something you already know a lot about if you’re thinking about building a product. Or, take some serious time and work in your target industry for a little while before starting to build a tool that may or may not work in that industry. 

#### Storytime with Jason: Selling to doctors

You’ve probably been a patient at one time or another, I certainly had. Not only that, I have a sister and a father who are both doctors and my team was engaged to build an enterprise Radiology Information System at one point. I felt like this gave me a pretty good understanding of the business of medicine. So when I started MedRev to help healthcare providers better understand and improve the experiences of their patients, I thought for sure this was going to be a slam dunk. 

What doctor wouldn’t want to improve their patients’ experiences so that they could improve their businesses and their practices? What doctor doesn’t value their reputation enough to make a simple choice and take a little extra time and spend a little extra money? What doctor doesn’t want their Google and Facebook reviews to be improved? What doctor doesn’t want to be better?

It turns out, a lot.

I had known for years that selling to doctors has hard, but this was a simple sale, or so I thought. The problem is clear and present, the solution is simple and cheap, and of course the need is overwhelming given the importance of customer reviews. 

Well, actually, it seems that a lot of doctors:

1. Don’t care what people think about them.
2. Have such a full book of business and don’t ever worry about more people coming because they are and have been booked for months out for the last several years.
3. Don’t believe that patients care about or read online reviews.
4. Have offices that are now owned by hospitals and no longer worry about much more than their day to day jobs since they are getting a paycheck no matter their outcomes.
5. Are super cheap.
6. Are getting ready to retire and don’t care about their reputation at all.
7. Don’t have a clue how to use a computer.
8. Rely on their office manger to make business decisions, but then don’t allow them to make any actual decisions or spend any money.

The list goes on, and the lesson remains. I didn’t understand what goes into selling to doctors, who to sell to, how to distribute or how the system was never going to sell if the doctors had to do so much as lift a finger to make it work. 

The only solution that would work for this industry was to build and maintain an integration into every major Electronic Medical Records \(EMR\) system so that as each patient left the office, the system would work automatically. I also had to learn a ton about how to sell enmasse to doctors, which is a big problem for someone looking to just get a few sales to start. 

It all seemed so simple in the beginning, and a few weeks of validation would have gone a very, very long way. The company didn’t fail, but sure cost a lot more to build than I expected, and we haven’t even talked about HIPAA compliance yet. 

### Onward!

So what do you think? Are you the right fit for this job? Do you know what you’re doing well enough to take it to the next step? If you’re still onboard, let’s tear this project apart and start putting together some numbers, timelines, structure, and more. 

The rest of this section is going to dig into the details of time, money, competition, buyers, and understanding if this project is going to be worth it or not. Get out the pen and paper and boot up the computer because you’re going to be looking at some spreadsheets, entering some information, and putting your idea under the microscope. 

If you’ve already started and are realizing that maybe it’s time to take a hard look at what you’re doing and where you’re going, as I have more times than I would like to admit, then this is a great place to start.

## Competitors

If you think you’re the first person to come up with this idea, you’re probably wrong. In fact, you’re almost definitely wrong. Maybe no one else has taken this idea to market, if you’re building something truly unique, but I doubt it. You probably just haven’t looked hard enough. 

In this section, we are going step by step through all the tricks to:

1. Find your competition
2. Understand their features
3. Understand their buyers
4. Understand their pricing
5. Know if you can compete with them

This step is a game changer. It will help you realize if this project is worth it, if you can be successful, and maybe even realize if there is a market before you even start. If you competitors aren’t doing something or doing it in some particular way, there’s probably a reason, and for the most part, it’s not that they’re uninformed.

Knowing your competition also means knowing your competitors buyers and buyer groups. This helps you find holes in the market and understand ways to reach out to people that are not being served, or serve them in a different way. We’re going to take a much deeper look at your buyers in the next section, and this initial competitor research will give us a great start there. So be sure to keep your notes on buyers from this chapter, we’re going to be using them next!

### Finding Your Competition

* Have you thoroughly researched your competition?
  1. Do you have competition?
     1. Yes - List your competitors
        1. Company
        2. List major features
        3. List prices/pricing
        4. What are the groups of people that your competitors are selling to?
        5. Screenshot their pricing pages
        6. Take a trial for each competitor
     2. No
        1. How did your search?
        2. Did you call companies or people with the problem and ask how they solve it now?
        3. Why is there no competition?
           1. Not a viable market
           2. Maybe you just stumbled onto a good idea that no one has come up with yet? Probably not though.
           3. They already went out of business
           4. There is a monopoly 
           5. There is already a solution that does not require a SaaS
     3. What are your indirect competitors?
        1. Competition
        2. What makes it indirect
        3. What percent of the market do they own?

## Buyers

* Who are your buyers?
  1. Did you ask people with the problem you are solving?
     1. What did they say?
  2. What is the current market size? 
  3. Is it worth selling to them?
  4. Ask current distributors
     1. Influencers
     2. Competitors
     3. Podcasts
     4. Youtube channels
     5. Facebook groups
     6. Consultants
  5. Creating a list:
     1. Ask the distributors
     2. Li, Tw, Fb groups, Ads, Socal Ads, Forums, Podcasts, tradeshows
  6. Survey your buyers - get a list of 10  - 1000 people from either your distributors or your lists
     1. Who are they?
        1. Role
        2. How long in business
        3. Do they have the problem?
     2. Do they have the need?
     3. Do they know they have a need?
     4. If not, why?
     5. Do they want the product?
     6. How much are they willing to pay?
     7. If you can’t create a list at the beginning of the project, how will you do it later?
  7. Do you know already? Are you sure?
  8. Can you make a list of buyers to call today? Most of the time, the answer is no.
  9. If yes, then can you break them apart into the different buyer types?
  10. If you can’t identify all of them, here is how to do it:
      1. Fake it up process
         1. Fake business
         2. Fake website
         3. Fake ads to drive ideas
         4. Figure out who they are
            1. Facebook customer validation process
            2. Test your messaging
         5. How do you identify them?
  11. Do they want what you’re selling?
      1. Test your messaging
      2. See if they will buy it
      3. Get their contact info
  12. Now that you have a set of people to reach out to, let’s talk… literally. 
      1. Get on the phone and CALL THEM
      2. Ask about who they are, what they want, how you can help them
      3. Understand their issues
         1. You will learn things you never realized about your product and offering
         2. You may realize that what you’re doing is going to be a huge success, or that it is not going to work
         3. You have to do things that don’t scale to enable things that do.
         4. Don’t underestimate the value of this.

## Sales & Distribution

* How will you be distributing this system? 
* Do you need a sales team?

## Time & Money

### What is your timeline to get to market?

People that are new to the industry rarely realize the amount of time and energy it actually takes to get a product to market. From ideation to market penetration, my experience is that most companies come in at around two years. Many of these businesses will have sales and/or market testing revenue prior to that time. But by the time they find their niche, their messaging, have the system set up for their users, and are able to start growing is very often around 2 years. 

#### Why two years?

For whatever it is that you’re building, unless it is exceedingly simple, plan on it taking at least a year to get the product right and understand your market fit. Then plan on another year of iterating on the product, getting to know your customers, building systems that match their needs, and starting to really take off.   


I’m not suggesting you can’t do it faster, I’m just giving you a good idea of what to plan for. Plenty of companies do this a lot faster, but plenty of companies also thought they could do it a lot faster and it ended up taking a lot longer or never evening getting to market. So as you’re planning your project, if you are racing to beat a competitor and they’re already a year ahead of you, you’re probably not going to beat them. If that’s the case, just remember that it’s a big world and there are a lot of buyers out there. 

### Do you understand your costs?

Understanding costs and revenue can quickly be the difference between being in and out of business. For the most part, SaaS businesses have fairly high margins, which is one of the biggest draws to this sector. It’s easy to think that because your margins are so high that you can withstand a few more costs, but that kind of thinking can quickly sink your business.  


Personally, I had this happen with my business MedRev. It is a patient experience analysis SaaS that works by sending out satisfaction surveys to patients from clinics, offices, and hospitals and returning back to them actionable information on how to improve their companies and processes. When we were getting started, I didn’t put much thought into the cost of systems operations outside of support because “How much could it possibly cost to send a few emails and texts?” It turns out it’s a lot if you’re going to be in compliance with all the US healthcare regulations, also known as HIPAA. To get all of our training, insurance, other legal issues, and security within the system, the costs turned out to be exceptionally high. The difference between sending out surveys while complying with HIPAA regulations versus just sending out business surveys turns out to be SIX TIMES more expensive! If we hadn’t already been so far into the system when I realized how low the margins were actually going to be, I may not have pursued it in the first place.  


But that’s a company that didn’t crash from unrealized costs, and there are plenty that did. In particular, one interview with a friend who wished to go nameless to protect the identities of his investors described a business that went totally bust from unconsidered costs.   


In his words “I didn’t need the full-time staff, I didn’t need the warehouse space, I didn’t need the office, and I certainly didn’t need all the perks we gave ourselves. But we got it because we thought we did. In the end, I could have done the whole thing working from home with no employees at all. Even though we made almost 200k at launch, the cost ended up killing us. Had I taken a step back at so many different points leading up to the end, maybe I could have made the hard decisions and cut the bleed, but I just didn’t realize it.”  


It’s the same story I’ve heard so very often, and have said myself. You have to take the time to do the math, and as my Mom says “Run the numbers,” or you’ll be out of business.   


This is not a simple table of data that you can just fill out a couple of fields and understand if this is going to work or not. We also need to do this in a spreadsheet so you can make complex modifications.   


Worksheet 1  


### How long will it take until you are cash flow positive and do you need investment? 

Whether you’re bootstrapping it or getting some big dollars, unless you’re Uber you’re going to need to know when to expect to be cash flow positive and profitable. Building this expectation into your plan is a necessary part of any business plan.   


Most experienced business owners would say “Of course you have to do this!” So I only bring it up because I have seen so many SaaS businesses that think they will somehow just make money at some point and that will be fine, without giving any thought toward checking to be sure their income or investment will support the timeline of business development and their go to market strategy.   


So let’s figure out how long it’s going to take before your business starts making money. The spreadsheet here will take you through some example costs and timelines so you can get a good idea of how things will look for you.   


What is the cost to build the system? - choose a round number, then double it.

What are your monthly costs?

* People
* Software
* Marketing
* Advertising
* Operations

How long will it take to gain market share? - pick an estimated time of at least 1 year and double it.  


What is your growth rate - start at 1% for AT LEAST the first 4 months, then you can go up to 2% to 5%. Aim for 20% within 6 months.

In this first part, we are just going to add some estimates, but in the future, we’re going to dig deep into these numbers so you can get a good idea of actual costs. The concept to grasp here is that your costs and revenue will grow over time. The goal is that your revenue grows faster than your costs and your end up making a profit that can also offset the initial capital outlay you put into the business.   


## The Secret Sauce

Sauces are made up of a lot of different components and they all have to come together to make something amazing. Without one ingredient, the sauce is missing something and doesn’t have the bang that it used to. This is the place where you’ll find some of those hard to find ingredients, but if you don’t have all the ingredients, it’s still not going to be very impressive.  


* Do you have pre-sales? Can you get presales?
* How will you be distributing this system? 
* Do you need a sales team?
* What is your unique selling proposition? 
* What is your unfair advantage?

### Example Case - 

David had gone through several of the aspects of the validation process, but he didn't reach out to his target market and talk to them first. It's that simple. If David had asked a few questions he would have realized that this wasn't going to work the way he expected. 

There are several ways this could have been accomplished. 

#### 1. Go to the tradeshow as an attendee and just ask people if they would buy the system. 

So many people I have spoken to when I recommend something like this say "I can't afford to spend 2k on a tradeshow where I'm not going to make any money!"

My answer is simple. Would you rather spend 2k figuring out if this will work or 100k building something you'll never make a dollar from? 

#### 2. Send a survey

If you don't know your audience, you probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. So, get started with taking a list of people in the industry and asking them all to take a quick survey. You'll want to have some aspects of what you're building ready to view before you do this, but even if you don't you can still ask questions. 

Even if you are entering a new market that you don't know that much about, you could take the following methods to find the people to ask:

1. Join an association and get their members list
2. Do market research and hire a VA \(virtual assistant\) to find email addresses
3. Run some ads on Facebook targeted towards your users and ask them to fill out your survey. You can also offer to compensate them. Just make sure to set up only a limit to the number of people you're going to pay. 

Here are some of the questions that David may have used for his target audience:

1. How do you currently collect local wage and benefits information from the largest local employers?
   1. We don't collect or distribute this data
   2. We have a consultant do this for us
   3. We use state-wide data
   4. We have an in-house person do this for us
2. How often do you collect this data?
   1. More than once a year
   2. Once a year
   3. Every other year
   4. Every three years
   5. Whenever we have time, but more than every 3 years
3. What is the cost of collecting this data?
   1. Free
   2. 1k - 5k
   3. 5k - 10k
   4. 10k - 20k
   5. 20k - 30k
   6. 30k+
4. What are your top frustrations with collecting this information?
   1. Text answer
5. For groups using consultants or in-house staff, what is your process for getting this data?
6. If there was a software system that just required you to send out a pre-built survey and make some followup calls to your industries, would you use it?
7. How much would you pay for this system?
   1. I wouldn't pay for it
   2. Less than 1k per year
   3. 1k - 2.5k per year
   4. 2.5k - 5k per year
   5. 5k - 10k per year
   6. 10k+ per year
8. What system features would you find most valuable? \(put in order of importance\) 
   1. The form would auto-fill last years' answers for industries \(link to video showing how this would work\)
   2. The system would anonymously collect all data and auto-compile it for you.
   3. Integrate with HRI systems to import industry compensation data automatically.
   4. Advanced web-based dashboard specifically built to help industries understand this data.
9. Would you buy this software if I built it?
   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. Maybe \(if maybe, why?\)
10. If yes: if I were to give you 50% off for the first year, knowing the system would be done a year from now, would you be willing to pay for the system now?
    1. Yes
    2. No
11. If yes, would you be willing to do a phone call with me to talk more about this?
    1. Yes - links to calendar scheduling system
    2. No
