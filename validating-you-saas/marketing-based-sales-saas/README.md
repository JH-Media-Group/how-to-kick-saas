# The SaaS Validation Process

## Validating a SaaS





SECTION IN PROCESS!!!

1. Start with the ‘why’. Why are you building this tool?
   1. I need it for me
      1. Have you checked to see if it is available on the web already?
      2. If so, why are you doing this?
   2. It’s a good idea and people need it.
      1. How long are you willing to spend building this tool and how much money do you have available?
   3. I have knowledge that others do not and I can make money selling it
   4. I already have a system built and think people will buy it.
   5. There is a similar system on the market and I think I can do it cheaper or better.
   6. I have a market already that needs this tool and can sell it as soon as it is done.
   7. I was hired to build it.
2. Do you know this market very, very well?
   1. If no, why are you doing this?
   2. Do you realize what you’re getting into?
3. I know this market very well because:
   1. I am the target market for this system
   2. I work with people who are the target market for this product
   3. I have done a substantial amount of research into this industry.
   4. I am not in the target market and don’t know the industry.
4. What is the problem, solution, & need?
5. We solve \_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_ - come back again after validation
6. What is the unique selling proposition \(USP\)? - come back again after validation
7. What is your unfair advantage? - come back again after validation
8. Competition
   1. Do you have competition?
      1. Yes - List your competitors
         1. Company
         2. List major features
         3. List prices/pricing
         4. What are the groups of people that your competitors are selling to?
         5. Screenshot their pricing pages
         6. Take a trial for each competitor
      2. No
         1. How did your search?
         2. Did you call companies or people with the problem and ask how they solve it now?
         3. Why is there no competition?
            1. Not a viable market
            2. Maybe you just stumbled onto a good idea that no one has come up with yet? Probably not though.
            3. They already went out of business
            4. There is a monopoly 
            5. There is already a solution that does not require a SaaS
      3. What are your indirect competitors?
         1. Competition
         2. What makes it indirect
         3. What percent of the market do they own?
9. Who are your buyers?
   1. Did you ask people with the problem you are solving?
      1. What did they say?
   2. What is the current market size? 
   3. Is it worth selling to them?
   4. If you can’t create a list at the beginning of the project, how will you do it later?
   5. Ask current distributors
      1. Distributors 
         1. Influencers
         2. Competitors

### Example Case - 

David had gone through several of the aspects of the validation process, but he didn't reach out to his target market and talk to them first. It's that simple. If David had asked a few questions he would have realized that this wasn't going to work the way he expected. 

There are several ways this could have been accomplished. 

#### 1. Go to the tradeshow as an attendee and just ask people if they would buy the system. 

So many people I have spoken to when I recommend something like this say "I can't afford to spend 2k on a tradeshow where I'm not going to make any money!"

My answer is simple. Would you rather spend 2k figuring out if this will work or 100k building something you'll never make a dollar from? 

#### 2. Send a survey

If you don't know your audience, you probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. So, get started with taking a list of people in the industry and asking them all to take a quick survey. You'll want to have some aspects of what you're building ready to view before you do this, but even if you don't you can still ask questions. 

Even if you are entering a new market that you don't know that much about, you could take the following methods to find the people to ask:

1. Join an association and get their members list
2. Do market research and hire a VA \(virtual assistant\) to find email addresses
3. Run some ads on Facebook targeted towards your users and ask them to fill out your survey. You can also offer to compensate them. Just make sure to set up only a limit to the number of people you're going to pay. 

Here are some of the questions that David may have used for his target audience:

1. How do you currently collect local wage and benefits information from the largest local employers?
   1. We don't collect or distribute this data
   2. We have a consultant do this for us
   3. We use state-wide data
   4. We have an in-house person do this for us
2. How often do you collect this data?
   1. More than once a year
   2. Once a year
   3. Every other year
   4. Every three years
   5. Whenever we have time, but more than every 3 years
3. What is the cost of collecting this data?
   1. Free
   2. 1k - 5k
   3. 5k - 10k
   4. 10k - 20k
   5. 20k - 30k
   6. 30k+
4. What are your top frustrations with collecting this information?
   1. Text answer
5. For groups using consultants or in-house staff, what is your process for getting this data?
6. If there was a software system that just required you to send out a pre-built survey and make some followup calls to your industries, would you use it?
7. How much would you pay for this system?
   1. I wouldn't pay for it
   2. Less than 1k per year
   3. 1k - 2.5k per year
   4. 2.5k - 5k per year
   5. 5k - 10k per year
   6. 10k+ per year
8. What system features would you find most valuable? \(put in order of importance\) 
   1. The form would auto-fill last years' answers for industries \(link to video showing how this would work\)
   2. The system would anonymously collect all data and auto-compile it for you.
   3. Integrate with HRI systems to import industry compensation data automatically.
   4. Advanced web-based dashboard specifically built to help industries understand this data.
9. Would you buy this software if I built it?
   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. Maybe \(if maybe, why?\)
10. If yes: if I were to give you 50% off for the first year, knowing the system would be done a year from now, would you be willing to pay for the system now?
    1. Yes
    2. No
11. If yes, would you be willing to do a phone call with me to talk more about this?
    1. Yes - links to calendar scheduling system
    2. No
