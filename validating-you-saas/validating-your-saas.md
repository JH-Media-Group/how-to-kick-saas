# Validating Your SaaS

## This is the MOST IMPORTANT thing in the book, don't skip it.

A lot of people get started with an idea, skip the validation, hire a team, and get going on the build of their project. Then, they get to the sales part and don't have a plan in place, know who they are selling to, understand how to reach those people, know what to say, and often end up realizing that either they built something that was not worth building or cannot compete in the market. 

### What normally happens:

1. I have an idea!
2. Hire a team to build my idea.
3. How do I sell this thing?
4. Throw money at marketing something that never had a chance in the first place.
5. Give up and complain about how the developers destroyed a great idea. 
6. Cry.

This happens more than anyone wants to admit. 

It hurts, it's embarrassing, it's a loss, and it can put you in the hole fast and in a bad way. It can ruin marriages and sink people into depression. If this is the position you're in now, it's ok. It happens to the best of us, and has happened to me more than once. Maybe you can pivot your business and still get some use out of the system, or maybe it's time to wash your hands of this, build up funds again and start over with a fresh perspective. Either way, you're going to learn a lot and it's going to [be better the next time](../the-business-of-saas/basic-lessons-of-saas.md#lesson-2-the-number-one-indicator-of-saas-success-youre-probably-going-to-fail-and-thats-ok). 

As you probably suspected, there's a much better way. 

## You MUST Validate Your Idea

There are a few people out there who did not do any validation and were still wildly successful. This is luck, plain and simple. For the rest of us, there is a process to ensuring success, it's call validation. For a SaaS project, I have outlined a process that works, but only if you do it.

The validation process outlined in this book is specific to SaaS products. But I recommend going further than just this and reading [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.](http://theleanstartup.com/) Since you’re already reading this book and you’re probably going to finish this one first, let's delve into the SaaS validation process. 

But first, let's talk about what happens when you don't validate.

## What happens when you don't validate

### David: Simple questions go a long way

David had an idea. He had been spending ten to thirty thousand dollars per year with consultants to get this data. For all of these years, those consultants were doing work that he _knew_ could be automated.

David was an Economic Developer at the regional level in the Southeastern US. He worked for the government and his job was to bring industries into a region. Part of doing this was to query regional industries about their wages and benefits so other businesses moving in would know what to expect to pay people, what benefits they needed to give, and the level of the workforce in the area. It was critical data, but it was hard to come by because no one wants to give that data away. But David had an idea.

It was so easy, just a few simple features; a surveying system to ask questions, a template with all the questions pre-built, some simple systems to enable the survey participants to flow through the survey faster than other systems, and he would have a for-sure sale. He knew the industry, he knew the people. Heck, he was one of them! 

After a 60k investment, a year of work, and more testing and frustration than he could have ever imagined, it was done. Time to take it to market, and he knew exactly where to go. He took the team to the regional association trade show to show off everything he had built. 

Over the course of the tradeshow his heart started to sink.

The system was perfect, it did exactly what he needed it to do. But over the course of three days, he realized that in states across the US other people in his industry didn't _want_ the software, they wanted someone to do the work for them. They _wanted_ the consultants. 

His target market didn't care about the software at all, what they wanted was the service, not the system. They didn't have time to implement the software he had built even if they wanted to. He had built a great system, but in the end, he could run the exact same business by just using the current industry leading survey software system and could have avoided all the cost of development. 

He realized that what he had built was not an innovative solution to a major problem. He was just a new consulting company to do the same work that all the other consultants were doing, but with less tested and less effective software. 

### Eyal: Lost money & lost reputation

Eyal approached me several years ago with a big problem and was in trouble. He had taken investment money from his friends and partners to build a SaaS. He heard about us through a friend and reached out immediately. It was the same story I'd heard so many times.

He was a prominent person in the community and had previously held a position at his full-time job that gave him access to a lot of wealthy friends. Several of those friends invested in his idea to the tune of almost half a million dollars. When we finally got in touch with me things were not going well for him. 

Eyal had invested all the money in the build of system and a substantial amount had been spent making changes as the system build progressed. When we connected he had an incomplete system, little to no money left for marketing, investors that were asking a lot of questions, and had no idea how to lead the company to success. He didn't know his next step, how to market the system, or where to look for advice. This was several years ago when there weren't nearly as many Facebook groups, books, and online courses as there are now to do this kind of project. Without access to more information on how to run the company, Eyal was in trouble, big trouble.

By the time Eyal and I connected, the business was already essentially over. He asked me if I would take the company off his hands and take virtually all of his shares in the system. He just wanted his investors to be made whole and have some amount of success or see some progress with the system. I couldn't take the project and it eventually went completely bust and all the investors lost their money. 

It was a terrible time for Eyal. His marriage, family life, and personal reputation suffered. He had a terrible time moving on from this time in his life. Eventually he did, but it was a scar that he still carries today. 

### Jake: College student with aspirations

Jake is a good guy. After all these years we still keep up with one another. Actually, as I am working on writing this book, I just saw that he and his wife had their first baby. 

Near the end of his college days, Jake had dreams of following in the footsteps of Mark Zuckerberg. Unfortunately, I didn't have the experience at the time to know how to tell Jake what a mistake this was going to be. His could have been a good idea with a lot of tweaks, a lot more focus, and had it not been directly competing with Facebook. 

It goes without saying that it didn't work out. Even then, I knew that you weren't going to take down Facebook in a head to head fight. They were already doing over a billion a year in revenue at the time, and Jake had a 50k budget. 

In the end, it was a great learning experience for both of us, but no one was particularly happy with the way it all went down. Jake and his investors lost the entire investment. Jake landed on his feet and now runs a great physical products company, but it took some time for him to recover from the first failure. 

### Marshall: The lawyer turned internet entrepreneur

Marshall was on stage the night I met him. He was playing guitar and singing his rendition of "I Took a Pill In Ibiza". He was having the time of his life, but I could see right away he looked worn down, and not from too many nights playing at private clubs. I soon found out that the private parties, guitar, and his vocals were his way of moving on from his previous endeavor. 

We sat in a corner seat while the pink show lights flashed and another musician took the stage. As we sipped a fresh craft beer, he started to tell me about how he was in a rough spot in his life after a failed SaaS project. 

Right away, it looked like a shadow came over him as he told me his story. He had hated his job as a corporate attorney at the same big firm his father had worked. His passion for music, story telling, and entrepreneurship had led him to a great idea about bringing it all together. So he used his high-roller connections in law to raise several million dollars to build an amazing music app, something I still consider to be one of the coolest music apps I've ever seen. But after years of work, it had failed and he's lost everything. His job, his reputation, some family connections, his relationship, and his morale. 

The plan he'd hatched was to build the tool, which came with some hefty monthly music licensing fees then sell it to some of the local large businesses such as AT&T and Turner Studios. The app itself was amazing, but it wasn't selling and the monthly fees were killing him. He spent two years trying to get the app built and another year or so trying to sell it. In the end, it wasn't possible. The system way the business and app were built, only a larger company could afford to run with it. Without a company with deep pockets supporting the system, it was doomed. 

By the time Marshall told me the story over more than a couple of beers late at night, the whole thing had already gone down. It was over and he was moving on. He brought up the possibility of me taking on the project, but it was far from my area of expertise, and I didn't think I could do any better than he could with the system. On top of that, he had just returned from a months long hike and soul searching across Spain on the El Camino De Santiago trail after non-stop work for several years followed by complete disappointment and he could barely stand to look at the thing app anymore. Marshall took it hard letting down his investors, his friends, his family, and his dreams.

Like Jake, Marshall bounced back and is doing great these days, but this experience took a big toll on him as well. 

### Dr. Russell

I met Dr. Russell when I walked into an entire floor rented out in a large office building in Atlanta, Georgia. It was a beautiful building and a huge office, but there were only three people working there, which I found really odd. 

We had received a call

## Critical Questions

In every one of these situations a few hours to a few days of time ensuring the product would sell, had a solid market, and was delivering something that was needed and wanted would have saved countless months and years of work, bankruptcy, ruined relationships, overwhelming debt, destroyed businesses, and the hopes and dreams of hard working, good people. The questions surrounding the feasibility and sustainability of major investments CANNOT be underestimated. Building a new business is no trivial matter, even for the wealthy, so don't take it lightly. 

Do your homework, be a professional, build a sustainable and profitable business, and live a good life. To do all of this, start by thoroughly validating your idea.
