# Validating Your SaaS

## Where to start?

A lot of people get started with an idea, skip the validation, hire a team, and get going on the build of their project. Then, they get to the sales part and don't have a plan in place. They quickly find out that what they built won't sell, doesn't solve the problem, and that they don't have the skill or knowledge to sell to their target market. 

### Here's what I see a lot:

1. I have an idea!
2. Hire a team to build my idea.
3. How do I sell this thing?
4. Throw money at marketing something that never had a chance in the first place.
5. Give up and complain about how the developers destroyed a great idea.

As you probably suspected, there's a much better way. 

## You MUST Validate Your Idea

You’ve got to validate your idea and get customers or potential customers to put money in your pocket as soon as possible in order to do so. That’s where the rubber meets the road, and where your success is determined.

To learn to validate your idea the best thing you can do is to read [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.](http://theleanstartup.com/) But since you’re already reading this book and you’re probably going to finish because this book is way more interesting than that book \(he’s actually a better writer than I am, so read his book\), here are the basics of what you need to do.

## Storytime with David: We didn't start out to build a consultancy

David had an idea. He had been spending ten to thirty thousand dollars, per facility per year with consultants to get this data. For all of these years, those consultants were doing work that he _knew_ could be automated. 

It was so easy, just a few simple features; a surveying system to ask questions, a template with all the questions pre-built, some simple systems to enable the survey participants to flow through the survey faster than other systems, and he would have a for-sure sale. He knew the industry, he knew the people. Heck, he was one of them! 

After a 60k investment, a year of work, and more testing and frustration than he could have ever imagined, it was done. Time to take it to market, and he knew exactly where to go. He took the team to the regional association trade show to show off everything he had built. 

Over the course of the tradeshow his heart started to sink.

The system was perfect, it did exactly what he needed it to do. But over the course of three days, he realized that in states across the US other people in his industry didn't want the software, they wanted someone to do the work for them. They _wanted_ the consultants. 

His target market didn't care about the software at all, what they wanted was the service, not the system. They didn't have time to implement the software he had built even if they wanted to. He had built a great system, but in the end, he could run the exact same business by just using the current industry leading survey software system and avoided all the cost of development. 

He realized that what he had built was not an innovative solution to a major problem. He was just a new consulting company to do the same work that all the other consultants were doing, but with less tested and less effective software. 

### How could this have been avoided?

David had gone through most of the aspects of the validation process, but he didn't get in front of a lot of other people and ask them specifically if they could and would use the system.

There are several ways this could have been accomplished. 

#### 1. Go to the tradeshow as an attendee and just ask people if they would buy the system. 

So many people I have spoken to when I recommend something like this say "I can't afford to spend 2k on a tradeshow where I'm not going to make any money!"

My answer is simple. Would you rather spend 2k figuring out if this will work or 50k building something you'll never make a dollar from? 

#### 2. Send a survey

If you don't know your audience, you probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. So, get started with taking a list of people in the industry and asking them all to take a quick survey. You'll want to have some aspects of what you're building ready to view before you do this, but even if you don't you can still ask questions. 

Even if you are entering a new market that you don't know that much about, you could take the following methods to find the people to ask:

1. Join an association and get their members list
2. Do market research and hire a VA \(virtual assistant\) to find email addresses
3. Run some ads on Facebook targeted towards your users and ask them to fill out your survey. You can also offer to compensate them. Just make sure to set up only a limit to the number of people you're going to pay. 

Here are some of the questions that David may have used for his target audience:

1. How do you currently collect local wage and benefits information from the largest local employers?
   1. We don't collect or distribute this data
   2. We have a consultant do this for us
   3. We use state-wide data
   4. We have an in-house person do this for us
2. How often do you collect this data?
   1. More than once a year
   2. Once a year
   3. Every other year
   4. Every three years
   5. Whenever we have time, but more than every 3 years
3. What is the cost of collecting this data?
   1. Free
   2. 1k - 5k
   3. 5k - 10k
   4. 10k - 20k
   5. 20k - 30k
   6. 30k+
4. What are your top frustrations with collecting this information?
   1. Text answer
5. For groups using consultants or in-house staff, what is your process for getting this data?
6. If there was a software system that just required you to send out a pre-built survey and make some followup calls to your industries, would you use it?
7. How much would you pay for this system?
   1. I wouldn't pay for it
   2. Less than 1k per year
   3. 1k - 2.5k per year
   4. 2.5k - 5k per year
   5. 5k - 10k per year
   6. 10k+ per year
8. What system features would you find most valuable? \(put in order of importance\) 
   1. The form would auto-fill last years' answers for industries \(link to video showing how this would work\)
   2. The system would anonymously collect all data and auto-compile it for you.
   3. Integrate with HRI systems to import industry compensation data automatically.
   4. Advanced web-based dashboard specifically built to help industries understand this data.
9. Would you buy this software if I built it?
   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. Maybe \(if maybe, why?\)
10. If yes: if I were to give you 50% off for the first year, knowing the system would be done a year from now, would you be willing to pay for the system now?
    1. Yes
    2. No
11. If yes, would you be willing to do a phone call with me to talk more about this?
    1. Yes - links to calendar scheduling system
    2. No

Think about this simple step for just a minute. An hour of time spent working on this survey and sending it out to friends who would absolutely complete the survey would have saved someone $60,000.00, a year of work, and countless hours of frustration. 

Don't let this be you. Don't be David.
