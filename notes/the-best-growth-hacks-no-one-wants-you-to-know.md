Some of my favorite emails come from:

* Sumo.com
* Hubspot.com
* Buffer.com

Roles and what they need:

* Developers want specs and tasks, need deadlines
* Designers want flexibility, need structure
* PMs want structure, need timelines
* Marketers want conversions, need data/analytics

The Inbetween - when you do your first sale and have validation, then need to finish building the thing!  


Set up times to do each thing - especially marketing items

Before we can spend a drop of your \(or someone else’s\) hard earned money, we need to know what we’re actually look at cost-wise for everything BEFORE and after you build the thing. There’s no point in building this thing if you can’t see it through to the end, is there?  
  


You did it!!! Now the dollars will just roll in! No more going to that 9 to 5 job, just sit back, relax, and wait for the millions of dollars to hit your bank account.

### SaaS Accounting - to do in next edition

### What do you think you are building/doing?

### Business canvas

### Validating your idea

### Validation canvas

### Tools of the trade

When building a SaaS business, there are a number of project aspects that most entrepreneurs don't consider. These are systems and implementations that will very often need to be built into the project.  


### Where is your customer in the buying cycle?

Understanding where your user falls in the buying cycle helps you understand how to interact with the user and what information to send them. So enabling your customer support team members to understand lead scoring can help automate their processes

### SaaS Pricing Metrics

This is  


Often ignored because it touches everything

Positioning = people

Packaging = presentation

Pricing = pricing

Customer acquisition costs \(CAC\)

CAC = total cost of sales and marketing / \# of customers acquired

In the CPC channel,

Lifetime value \(LTV\)

LTV/CAC is the math your entire business is built on  


If you position price package effectively, then a significant part of your sales and marketing job is done already. Without it, you are attracting the wrong people that don’t fit your value.

ARPU = Average Revenue Per User

LTV = ARPU/Churn Rate

LTV \(simplified\) = \(sum of all customer mrr / total \# of customers\) / \(\# customers who churned / total \# of customers\)

Value metric = what you selling that determines price

Reducing churn comes from giving customers true value, which they get if the positioning is precise.

LTV/CAC ratio of &gt;1 is good, but not good enough. You need substantially higher LTV than CAC. At least a 3 to 1 ratio to run a successful business. But more like an 11 to 1 ration.

CAC increase -  better positioning and packaging to target ideal customers

LTV increase - higher prices and better retention

Grows customers and revenue  


Average SaaS company spends 6 hours over their whole lifecycle on pricing.  


Value based pricing is best

Cost plus vs. competitor based vs. value based - your own strategy  


If you are just giving someone what is already out there with the same packaging, same price, etc. they are just going to go with what is already out there.  


Could be called ‘customer based pricing’  


Your SaaS company exists to offer value to your customers. This is why the only viable option in SaaS pricing is value based pricing.  


Quantified buyer personas are the foundation of your entire pricing strategy.

Without advanced buyer personas, you are reduced to ‘guess and check’ marketing and development.  


You need:

How to identify your highest value customers so you can position effectively

What are the valued features of your packaging that different subsets of customers really want?

What these types of customers willing to pay for the right product for them?

Are the unit economics such as CAC of these customers profitable  


Need to know:

Company size

Industry

Role  


Look at current customers and build profiles from there. Use profitwell to pull up payment info and sort by MRR  


Willingness to pay

* People are not good at tell you if your product is worth $99/mo or $79/mo.
* 4 questions from Van Westenhorps Price Sensitivity meter:
  * At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive it is not worth buying? \(too expensive\)
  * At what price would you consider the product starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? \(Expensive/high\)
  * At what price would you consider the product to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good \(too cheap\)
  * At would price would you consider the product to be a bargain - a great byy for the money? \(cheap/good value\)

The highest share of the market is found in the trough at the bottom. This is the price point where the maximum percentage of sales can be found. However, you can also see other price points that may return higher profits. In this case, moving from $200 to $400 barely sacrifices market but potentially has far better LTV per customer.  


For CPC channel:

CPC to CAC

CAC =  CPC / % trial x % paid  


Your pricing page:

The demographics are condensed into a single word that best describes that persona: a bootstrapper, a startup, a growing company, or a large unicorn.  


The willingness to pay is shown in the actual pricing, which grows with the growing demographics and features.  


The packaging of the valued features show the relative preferences of each buyer persona. The Bootstrap persona only wants quick and easy access to the product, while Growth wants custom analytics and support.  


Quantifying your buyer personas gives you concrete starting points for your pricing and packaging, showing you exactly what your customers value, and what they are willing to pay.  


If you know what feature your customers really value then that should be the first thing they see when they hit your landing page.  


Your sub-landing pages can be designed around each of the main features for each buyer persona.  


You can construct your sales funnel to pass through different features as potential customers travel to your pricing page  


Though you should always be looking for ways to maximize efficiency within a SaaS, cutting back on CAC is generally the unfavored option to increase your LTV/CAC ratio. Customers, particularly the high-value ones, cost money to acquire. Cutting back here means cutting back on acquisition, leading to further problems.  


Value Metrics - what you’re charging for

You need to have something that scales up cost with the size of the business. Period.  


1. To be easy to understand 2. To align with your customer’s needs 3. To grow with your customer

Why A Value Metric Means You Grow As Your Customers Grow  


Growing with your customers is all about getting the thresholds for your value metric correct. Though you should have an idea of the correct pricing and thresholds from your buyer persona willingness to pay data, the only way to drill down on exactly what works is to continually test and optimize.  


Value metrics are the best way to optimize your pricing for growth.    


Growth levers:

* Acquisition
* Retention
* Monetization

This data, taken from our study of 512 SaaS companies, shows that just a 1% improvement in monetization allows you to increase revenue by 12.7%. This makes it by far the best growth lever in your business. Monetization is almost 4X more effective than acquisition at raising your bottom line.  


One plan per persona

Each persona should have 3 elements:

1. Demographic data The size and type of target company, along with specific title and role definitions from individuals at those companies. This is common buyer persona information, but yours should be based on current customer data rather than just brainstorming.
2. Valued features The results from your market research and feature value analysis. Each buyer persona should have different features that they value over others.
3. Willingness to pay Price sensitivity data from your market research showing pricing ranges that each buyer persona will pay for their most valued features or positioning on your value metric scale.

Your pricing page is the most important page on your marketing site.

This is the most important page of your marketing site. It is the one that is going to convince prospects to sign up or not. To part with their hard-earned revenue or not. So the design has to be right  


Need to consider price localization

But by discounting, you have already hurt that value.  

Discounting Undervalues Your Product Both Externally and Internally
